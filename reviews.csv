A$AP Rocky,"A$AP Rocky was perched at the top of a three-story church pleading with the �Holy Ghost� as his millennial choir echoed his prayers back at him. The 26-year-old rapper from Harlem, New York might claim to have his own relationship with God, but it�s no secret that he also maintains his own cult. Those faithful followers were more than happy to �turn the fuck up� in order to provide Rocky with the energy he needed to get through his performance last night. He spoke about some mysterious �battle� when he performed at the Ogden Theater a few years ago, but he was fighting something different this time around; he was fighting the flu. Although it�s not uncommon to see someone puke at Red Rocks, usually that someone isn�t the headliner. Rocky is a fighter though. So when the sickness crept up on him, he just spit that shit out and continued on with his set. In fact, although it was a slightly abbreviated set, it was far superior to what I witnessed at the Ogden last time around. Flu symptoms aside, Rocky and the present members of his A$AP Mob have found their stage legs in the past few years. It might seem ridiculous to call A$AP Rocky a professional (he is the same guy who started brawling with the crowd at SXSW in 2012), but I think anyone who comes out and not only does their job, but does it in style (while deathly ill), is deserving of the denotation. I am getting ahead of myself here though, because before Rocky, there was Vince, Danny and Tyler� - See more at: http://ilistensoyoudonthaveto.com/2015/10/02/rocky-and-tyler-tour-red-rocks-09-30-15/#sthash.zNL1Rrye.dpuf "
A$AP Rocky,"Rakim Mayers, better known by is stage name of A$AP Rocky, is an American rapper and Hip Hop artist. A$AP Rocky, before he became the hip hop legend, suffered years of hardship whilst young and living in Harlem, New York. He reinvented himself and was rewarded for his hard work with a blooming career as a hip hop artist. A$AP Rocky is one member of the A$AP collective, a whole team of rappers and hip hop artists. Joining the A$AP mob launched Rocky�s career and gave him his chance to start over and reach for the stars. Rocky� struggles are evident in his voice when he raps, and by what he raps about. His music is incredibly raw and real, with deep emotion and pain. He is a breath of fresh air away from the normal rapper who mindlessly raps about �bitches� and �hoes�. The atmosphere at an A$AP gig is pure madness: everyone from ghetto to suburban kids turned up and people were going mental for the music. It was fun and exciting, the crowd dancing so hard that it had the air of a flash mob about it. Rocky took the mic for �Peso� and the crowd went wild, crowd surfing him as he rapped. It was a fantastic night all round. "
A$AP Rocky,"I went to see both A$AP Rocky and Wiz Khalifa at the Genting arena during their European tour. Me and a friend got there early enough to be stood two or three people from the front. The supporting acts were decent, Chevy Woods failed to get the crowd going as much as Wiz Khalifa did, however they succeeded in the purpose of getting the audience hyped. Wiz had the longer set and despite having a reputation for being one of the world's biggest stoners, he was lively and really succeeded in getting the crowd going. He sprayed champagne on me and my friend. I did not primarily come for Wiz however, I was more curious to see what A$AP had in store. He had the shorter set, which took a little while to get going as he stood behind some sort of curtain for a good ten minutes. However, when the show got into full swing Rocky and the Mob got the crowd jumping and at one point, moshing. I feel that A$AP could have maybe played a few more tracks as some of my favourites were missed. But overall, I would recommend anyone go and see them, as I had an amazing time! "
A$AP Rocky,"Rakim Mayers, otherwise known as ASAP Rocky became one of the most exciting new artists in US hip hop in 2013 when his debut album 'Long. Live. ASAP' topped the billboard chart and made waves all over Europe. A confident, high level of rap and hip hop earned the album critical acclaim and his status increased dramatically. Now the rapper has a crew and live show to support the credentials. From the opening beats of 'Long Live ASAP' the crowd are treated to a demonstration of world-class new hip hop. The setlist blends so well due to the frontman's ability to freestyle yet when he does break to appreciate the adoration, the response is huge from the audience. Big tracks such as 'Wild For The Night' receive massive cheers as the group perform this massive hip hop track with intensity. Most of the time, the frontman ends up crowd surfing following a huge performance of finale 'Fuckin' Problems' and this was no different as ASAP launches himself as the audience enthusiastically carry him around the venue whilst continuing to dance along. "
A$AP Rocky,"This show was so live! I am very satisfied with my purchase. Vince Staples opened & he killed it. I even more of a fan now, he is really one on the come up. Danny Brown performed next and OMFG he lit the crowd up. Mosh pits went off which doesn't bother me but I wish the people who choose to announce that whoever doesn't want to be by it get out of the way.. But it was lit. Rocky came out and performed JD which was dope as the first song he preformed. He played his new shit, some old. nearly all of the ASAP mob was there they preformed hella hoes which got everyone hypppeeeee af Flacko and Danny did 1 train which was a dream come true. They even played nirvana Everything about this show was such an amazing experience, great crowd too. Love these three together so happy they're on tour together "
A$AP Rocky,"The doors supposedly were supposed to open at 6:30. The show was listed as 8pm. The doors were not open until 9:15, while it was 10� outside. NOT COOL. I seriously couldnt feel my toes, fingers, my body was trembling through the first song! I arrived at 8 expecting the doors to be open, and tag in the back of the line. I was towards the front and still waited for an hour and a half to get in. Once inside tho I was amazed by the venue, (it was my first time to the armory) and rocky was just as beautiful as expected. Seriously cold tho, like might think twice the next time a show is at this venue. "
A$AP Rocky,"The concert was amazing when it started! The stage set ups and changes were all very exciting! But the delay of the concert and waiting in the freezing cold for 3 hours was not the greatest part, when I did dress in layers. The cold got unbearable I almost had to leave. I had to leave early and only saw 15 minutes of A$AP because the last train left st 12:45. Since it was so delayed and was more delayed in between acts I did not get to see much of my favorite artist. He is an inspiration and icon to me and I wish I could of stayed. Other then the delay and cold it was amazing while it lasted! "
A$AP Rocky,"Terminal 5 really screwed over the fans and most of us waiting about 3 hours in the freezing cold (below freezing temperature and wind) to get into the venue. So unfortunately that happened. Once there, the vibe was popping and there was such good energy all around. A$AP was a bit too amped, shall we say, to give his full set so he only ended up doing a couple songs with the Mob supporting. We only saw 1.5 hours of music which was disappointing but what I did get to see was awesome. "
A$AP Rocky,"A$AP Rocky is one of the best performers I have seen!! He puts on an astounding show and you are able to see how much time and effort went into it. Every piece during the show was put together well and incorporated the theme in every aspect onstage. I also loved the fact he played his favorite songs by other artists and even BROUGHT THEM OUT, such as Tyga and Drake. A$AP Rocky's concert was a great experience and I highly recommend going to one if he comes to a city near you. "
A$AP Rocky,"Unfortunately our A$AP experience was poor because of Terminal 5 and other factors. We had to wait over 1 hour and a half in 6 degree weather due to reasons that were never explained to us. A$AP and his boys only come on for 20 minutes - midnight curfew. Those 20 minutes were dope and rowdy, but what a shame. "
A$AP Rocky,It was overall a really amazing show and my second time seeing him at Bill Graham. He played a long set and the whole production was really cool. The openers were also good and came on on time. Overall amazing and I am sure I will continue to go to as many of his concerts as they have in SF. 
A$AP Rocky,"Long live ASAAAAAAP! Show was captivating.  Rocky outdid himself with a captivating performance.  Every lyric and every beat were perfectly timed.  True master of his craft! Church bells and choir sounds, tell 'em, ""Quiet down"" Bow your head, the Most High's around ASAAAAAP "
A$AP Rocky,"Equally as good live as he is recorded. The whole show was incredible, with each performer keeping the energy up in the crowd and presenting flawless performances. Staging was very impressive as well. Definitely go see if you have the chance, I am incredibly happy I got to go. "
A$AP Rocky,"This concert was so worth it! I loved the interactive experience and how the whole crowd was vibing with him, he stayed longer than he was allowed because of how much he loved the crowd and performed all songs he felt like we would love "
A$AP Rocky,"Absolutely fucking amazing. Him and Wiz Khalifa both killed it, music was sick, set was sick, stewards were arseholes but it's not exactly A$AP's fault for that. Atmosphere was just amazing. Overall it was just beastly man. "
A$AP Rocky,"Probably one of the best concerts I've ever been to- a fantastic performer and artist overall. Highly recommend seeing him live- although I had to wait in 10 degree weather for about an hour, it was worth it in the end. "
A$AP Rocky,"The concert was amazing, best night ever, A$AP Rocky & Wiz Khalifa tore up the o2 area. A$AP mob was killing it and the opening act Chevy Woods as epic. The whole night was great and I'll definitely be going again. "
Metallica,"A most memorable night as the boys set out to open the new Royal Arena with a bang. And that they did! From the opening of Hardwired it was clear they were here and they meant business! The most in-your-face opening of a Metallica gig I have ever witnessed. While there were a few noticeable ""hiccups"" in James' voice it was, to my ears, nothing major. But evidently it prooved to be just that. James told us he and a few of the others weren't feeling well and about 30 minutes into the show he had a talk with Lars, center-stage, and at this point most of us looked at each-other and thought, ""Uh-oh. Something's up. They're gonna cancel..."" James adressed the crowd, saying the band weren't sounding good and that he hated giving us a bad show. He wanted to stop. He asked the crowd outright, if we wanted a make-up show later with Metallica in full force or if they should continue at half mast. The crowd roared a reassuring and supportive ""No!"" - meaning: It's OK, James. We are here for you. We want you to battle on. We can do this together. He laughed warmly, thanked the crowd for our support and said, ""You asked for it"". They reorganized, changed the set-list and came out again and this time it seemed there was more energy in their performance. They were out to proove that they could do this, illness be damned! And as James asked for the crowds help in singing the lyrics, it didn't feel like all the other times he had done so. This was special. For once, you actually felt as if you were helping James, helping the band, through this ordeal. Together. And it felt mighty good. Sometimes this whole ""Metallica-family""-thing gets a bit worn-out and clich�, at least for me. But in that moment I felt it. The kinship. The coming together. And that was a mighty thing. A mighty good thing. The band soldiered on, ripping into a mighty version of Fade to Black, that hit home a bit more than it used to. Yes, there was an incident with Kirk during the intro, first missing his cue and then playing false notes, but not one of the critics questioned why. Just prior to Fade Kirk had done a solo thrasing his guitar around. For Fade he was then given another guitar, but the receiver on it cut out leaving him muted. They quickly gave him another guitar, the same he'd used for the solo, which was not tuned to Fade thus producing false notes. He finished the intro and they quickly changed guitars again, this time with a working receiver and in-tune. It's ok to criticize if the criticism is justified. Factless criticism is just whining. So they battled on raising the roof with a feroscious rendition of Seek and Destroy and the most pummeling version of Battery I've ever heard. Absolutely blistering. And closing out with Sandman with the crowd in full roar was just perfect. It was a truly memorable concert both performance and set-wise. Oh, and they even included Harvester of Sorrow which was a very nice surprise for me. The stage was beautiful with a built-in screen. And a screen in the ceiling as well. Epic and beautiful. A memorable night I won't forget as long as I live. As a fan, they did me proud with this one. I just hope James recovers and regains his strenght once again. Hetfield, rise! "
Metallica,"The impatient wait had been going on for months - I booked this show when tickets went on sale back in March or whenever it was, and October had take so long to come around - but finally it was here: Metallica day! The day started with a trip to the pop-up merch store in London, then onto the O2 for an agonising queue (good thing it's what us Brits do best, apart from moan about it of course) before finally getting in and finding my seat - which, by pure luck, was a superb view. Again, what felt like days, but in reality was only 30-40 mins wait, the lights dimmed, the background music shut off, and the familiar notes of the intro track, ""The Ecstasy of Gold"", complete with video footage from ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"", began to ring out, to rapturous roaring and whistling from the 20,000 strong crowd. The hairs on my arms are standing on end just recounting it for this review. And then we were in: full-bore, 100mph, Metallica took to the stage and belted out song after song after song with barely a moment to catch your breath before the next does of thrash metal came your way. ""Thrash metal?"", I hear you say, ""Metallica hasn't been thrash metal since the 80's!"". Oh my friend, trust me when I say thrash metal - we had some of the best early work represented tonight, not least with half a dozen track from the new album ""Hardwired... To Self Destruct"" that included unrelenting riff after riff, from the likes of ""Hardwired"", ""Atlas Rise"", ""Moth Into Flame"", coupled with one of the heaviest tracks they've ever written ""Dream No More"", plus ""Halo on Fire"" and ""Now That We're Dead"". All segmented in-between some of the bands greatest songs; ""Seek & Destroy"", ""Through The Never"", ""Welcome Home (Sanitarium)"", ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"", ""Through The Never"", ""One"", ""Sad But True"", ""Fuel"", the obligatory cover, this time from the Misfits' ""Die Die My Darling"", before ending the show with ""Master of Puppets"". Of course, it wasn't the end - back for the encore the intro to ""Damage Inc"" came on, before they ripped all the way through it, eventually slowing the pace to play the ever-loved ""Nothing Else Matters"" and finally ending on probably their most well known song ""Enter Sandman"" It was a great varied selection of tunes that spans most of their career - the only notable exceptions being there was nothing from ""Load"", ""St Anger"" or the previous record ""Death Magnetic"". But otherwise all the other studio albums were represented. Some guitar and bass doodles from Kirk and Rob, before Rob gave us a wonderful tribute to Cliff by playing ""Anesthesia"". If you get the chance to go, then go see this show - it's truly magnificent, from a band with 36 years experience in being the biggest metal band on the planet, and it shows you just why they are. I just wish I had a ticket for tomorrow night too. "
Metallica,"We went to a concert in Toronto to see; Volbeat, Avenged Sevenfold, and the show I have been waiting my life to see; Metallica. They all sported the Blue Jays jersey with their names at some point and thanking them for the gifts. The show had a Dj mixing up songs before/between acts from groups like Beastie Boys to Black Sabbath. Volbeat and avenged Sevenfold were great acts my first seeing all. My 16yr old is really into Avenged Sevenfold and was not disapointed. (end of grade 10 present). Volbeat i have heard in passing once and will do my best to spread the word about them.Glad i made it there in time to catch Volbeat if you ever have a chance make sure you catch them! Avenged Sevenfold was everything my 16 year old had told me.  Those who missed them may be may be able to catch them soon as they alluded to coming back. They make me glad that metal is carring on to the younger generation these days. ""We love Canada, we love you guys you're so nice and you always get us @#$!*&-up!"" They were amazed that as Canadians when he made reference to the flag from another country someone was holding up we cheered not booed ""cause thats just how nice you all are!""Finally but not least in any way Metallica.First of all their pyrotechniques were amazing boasting two small hot air ballons above them. The stage was set up so everyone had a good view and sported large screens for those further back to follow the rifts as well. At one point they were all on drums together each sporting their own.James Hetfield after noticing a young 8 yr old in the audience made reference to the""...Metallica family, young, 'medium' and old."" They played flawlessly and didnt disapoint their fans. My 16 year old was excited to see Metallica and who influenced not only her Mom and friends but the music yet to come out. The screens showed videos like clips from ""the unforgiven"" to lead up the one of the many big hit songs. The encore was what i was waiting for...the two songs my friends and I have been singing since grade school. What a great venue; no big line up for anything but marchandise. Thanks to all who made the show work:-) "
Metallica,"Metallica@RoyalArena03feb2017 Overall it was great. A blast of a concert! What wasn't so great mostly has to do with inexperience among staff of the arena itself, and the fact that it was premiere night on a brand new untried venue. Plus the tech geeks victory over common sense in arena design. There was trouble with wi-fi connections, which initially meant doors opened 10-20minutes late due to ticket validation.(whiplash experience) Bar staff initially unaware of validity of drink tickets (VIP-bracelet) Understaffed bar and merchandise shop in lounge area. Lounge area cramped. The room could have been 3 times the size to comfortably hold that many people. This was only a problem until early access was given to GA floor, as many went in at that time. Luggage handling/storage at Royal Arena is a total disaster. There were no oversized lockers. People had to be in possession of an IOS or Android smartphone (not windows compatible) with mobile pay on it, which excludes 10-25% of Danish concertgoers and 100% of foreigners. Redo ASAP! Loose codes and an arena tech was assigned to deal with the issue analogous, but it was too little too late, and will be a reoccurring issue in the future. Those were - except for luggage - all minor things, and this review has to end on a very positive note with a great shoutout to the crew at CID entertainment for going the full mile to make everyone as comfortable as possible and making everything work on the fly. Thanks guys! General arena design is also top shelf, and can endure LOUD bands to the extent that no other large scale arena in Denmark can follow. Thumbs up for that! As for Metallica - James wasn't well. We could hear it; he told us himself too. The crowd wanted it to happen so bad, and it did. I only hope there has been no permanent health damage induced by playing the (almost) full show. Metallica delivers - every single f#$!ing time! "
Metallica,"Electrifying as ever with their incredible performance and stage presence, the members of Metallica delivered the goods and more last night with a nice cross section of numbers running the gamut of their colossal catalog!  There were occasional pauses to interact and converse with the crowd, but the band segued their way into one song after another the majority of the evening.  The night opened up with an intro of the Ecstasy of Gold followed by the title cut off of the band's latest effort Hard Wired to Self Destruct.  James Hetfield's vocals were as strong as ever from beginning to end.  Kirk Hammett engaged in one brain crushing guitar solo after another, Lars Ulrich brought a great and almost nonstop back beat with his furious drumming and Rob Trujillo provided excellent bass work including a great treatment of the solo the late Cliff Burton was well known for on Anesthesia (Pulling Teeth).  During the aforementioned bass solo video footage of Burton performing onstage accented the music perfectly.  Other exceptional highlights included Kirk's stellar guitar shredding accompanied frequently by usage of his wah pedal.  Cuts such as Welcome Home (Sanitarium), Creeping Death and the encore Enter Sandman in particular contained solos showcasing his seemingly boundless talent!  Things heated up literally as well during the songs Fight Fire with Fire and Sandman when pyrotechnics were activated and flames shot up from the stage.  At the end Ulrich tossed sticks out into the audience.  Hetfield, Trujillo and Hammett threw and shook picks from little jack o' lantern tins out into the crowd, the picks of which boasting the band logo as well as the theatre's location and concert date on them.  Great souvenirs in even something so small right there as my husband and I each scooped one up off the floor!  A grand night out, the next one of which cannot come soon enough! "
Metallica,"2nd September show in Cobenhagen. Tallica promised us a unique show because this concert was postponed show from February. Many people travel a long way to see them in February including me traveling from Iceland. The moment when I heard Seek & Destory in the #3rd slot then I knew this was going to be something special. They performed Thought The Never in slot #4 and that song has not been played for 4 years. The next song was The Day That Never Comes and we did not believe that because in our wildest dreams we hoped to have that on the list, we jumped like there was no day tomorrow. Dream No More was in the slot #7 and that was the second time Metallica has played that song. It was nice to hear Breadfan in slot #10. We saw many drons flying over the stage in Moth Into Flame, which was amazing! Fight Fire With Fire was in the encore faster than ever. Me and my friends walked away from Royal Arena in great mood with a big smile on our faces and with a hoarse throut, like James was in February. About the unique show as we where promised in February it was only UNIQUE for 2 days because Amsterdam got almost the same setlist. But we got a free T-shirt, that was probably the unique thing for us. We where hoping for some live debut like Murder One, Spit Out The Bones but it did not happend. The song ManUnkind was performed tonight in Paris (10th September) and that is unique. Iceland has been waiting since 2004 for Metallica to come back to Iceland when they held the biggest indore concert in Reykjav�k. We do not want to wait another 23 years like we did before 2004. All the best, Gauti Sigurp�lsson "
Metallica,"Over 10 years, I got to see Metallica 7 times and each experience was in a different country. I have to admit the venues look different and incorporate a new way to watch the band but the musical vibe remains intact. They have shaped into an incredibly professional and hard-working live band. We can argue about and discuss their new album materials but one thing is guaranteed with Metallica: you will get only the best from their live performance.    If you have not seen them live, just go to one gig. Doesnt matter if you are not a metal fan because the experience they deliver is incredible. I have seen families at their shows and even people who do not understand nor appreciate metal, but they all seemed to be excited from what they were witnessing.    The only pity with Metallica is that you will most likely never have the chance to see them in a small venue. They are just too big of a band in demand and only deliver in large outdoor festivals or stadiums. This summer they had a new style of set list where people could request via voting for songs. The top songs define the set list and this gives a chance for people to vote for what they want to hear. The only unfortunate thing about all this is that people are voting for songs they already play each tour. People should vote to get them to play new songs from their past, which they havent performed over 20 years. I was in Helsinki (their first European gig for 2014) and they had to play ""The Frayed Ends of Insanity"" and it was ecstatic.    \m/ "
Metallica,"Do you like your rock shows huge, loud & engaging? Do you like stage sets that fill entire arena floors, filled with gigantic set pieces & enough pyro to blow up a small country? Do you like singing along to tightly played, iconic songs for 2-3 hours with thousands of friends? If yes, Metallica are your guys. Each show starts when The Ecstasy of Gold (theme song from The Good, The Bad & The Ugly) plays over the PA, and crowd anticipation hits a fever pitch with thousands shouting along with the melody. Just thinking about the opening gives me goosebumps. Once Ecstasy hits its crescendo, they hit the stage like a thunderbolt, hammering through their lineup of classic tunes to a screaming, fist pumping, metal-sign-throwing crowd. Grizzled metal fans join together with legions of kids (oftentimes their own kids), shouting out every word of every song, and even singing along with guitar solos & melodies.    Their set list varies each night. There are standards that they have to play, and you'll of course hear plenty of their big songs such as Enter Sandman and Master of Puppets. But they mix things up extremely well and no two nights are ever quite the same. It's amazing to me that after 30+ years and thousands of shows, the guys in the band still love mixing things up, still love goofing around on stage, still love engaging with the crowd, and obviously just love playing live & generating crazy crowd energy. Quite simply, they are the kings of arena metal. Bow to the kings! "
Metallica,"May 17, 2017 Nassau Coliseum This was the first time I have been to a Metallica show. James has the best personality on stage. He gets the entire crowd into the show; into the mood; very laid back style.  I like the fact the guys walk around the stage from different angles so that no matter where you sit, you can take excellent photos of them; that I have to give credit for that they do think of the fans in that aspect.  The special effects were beautiful and showed in my pictures with my camera.  James is very considerate of the fans from all aspects, you have to be in the Metallica Family...and you have to sing along with them...you just have to...the band played all the hit songs from present to past, no complaints.  Saved the best song for last...Sandman....The sound system was excellent all around, no complaints.  I am in still in shock; this was the best show I have ever seen in my life.  They really have fun while playing they keep your interest up...James will  not let the fans down..this band wants total audience participation...that is what to me, really stole the show. they do love and appreciate the fans....that is what stuck with me the most for a 1st time live performance is they really care about the fans..that really impressed me... "
Metallica,"It was my first time in Turkey. From S�o Paulo to Istanbul I needed to take a 12-hour flight.    12 hours and 5 days. The necessary time to enjoy the unique atmosphere of the city before finally seeing one of the most amazing concerts I have ever seen!    For me the concert had started when I met another crazy fan at the metro stations, going to Istanbul Technical University Stadium. So, after a few minutes, I was there. And I was able to see the power Metallica have to gather so many people from many countries. Lebanon, Kazakistan, Iran. Like me, a Brazilian guy.    I admit I have not known the opening band, Pentagram. But the sound those guys had played left me so surprised. What an awesome performance! I had felt the emotion of being part of a rock concert when people started to sing the lyrics.  Two hours later, time has come. Metallica by Request. The last European tour concert. The moment to listen the powerful voice of James Hetfield, the aggressive way to perform his guitar riffs, and all the greatest Metallica classical musics in front of me. In front of thousands of fans. Starting the concert playing ""Master of Puppets"" had been their way to say: Enjoy the best concert of your lives!    Long live Metallica! Horns up! \m/ "
Metallica,"METALLICA VOLBEAT AVENGED SEVENFOLD METALLICA METCLUB SINCE 1981 SO THE FUCK WHAT1991 www.metallica.com VOLBEAT REBELS & ANGLES FUCK YOU WERE FROM DENMARK Metallica, one of the biggest selling acts in American history, were born on October 28, 1981 when drummer Lars Ulrich and guitar player/singer James Hetfield got together via Ulrich�s LA Recycler newspaper ad. Soon, the two had recruited Hetfield�s friend and housemate Ron McGovney to play bass, Dave Mustaine to play lead guitar, and taken the name Metallica after a suggestion from Bay Area metal scene friend Ron Quintana. Their ascent was to be relatively quick, driven by sheer work-rate, effort and a rare musical chemistry. After hitting the opener�s circuit in LA (where they supported the likes of Saxon) they recorded their first ever demo No Life �Til Leather. The tape-trading circuit went crazy for it, and after repeatedly well-received shows in the Bay Area, Metallica found themselves relocating there after convincing bassist Cliff Burton to leave his band Trauma and replace McGovney. East Coast metal merchant Jon Zazula pitched tting busier and more international, the bands� stature rapidly grew. I band�s previous "
Metallica,"I finally discovered Metallica a little over two years ago. I mean properly discovered them and decided I was in love. Despite one of my best friends being a huge fan and trying to convert me for 16 years!! But I happened to hear master of puppets while I was alone in the car. And that's it, I became hooked. I already had tickets to Leeds 2015 when Metallica were announced to headline and loved every minute. So when the opportunity arose to see them again I had to enter the ballot. this was the best gig I've ever been to. The atmosphere was amazing. And the venue was stunning, unusual and gave great sound. My ears were ringing by the end but so worth it.  I feel like I've missed out by not being a fan much sooner and if I could go back in time I'd realise I really should have listened to my best friend!! And it looked like all the crowd were having as much fun.  I saw some elaborate air guitar antics, and suffered hair envy at some of the men head banging!!(my hair won't grow that long) Massive thumbs up on the whole evening. Not just from me but I'm sure everyone else in there. Oh and to top it off- Metallica put on an awesome show all for charity!!!! "
Metallica,"Metallica have a great set list to choose from, on occasions they make some strange picks. GREATS like Puppets, One, Creeping death. A left field Clover which is great, then long absent memory remains. `Then come the stranger choices, like anything off st Anger.  The pace is affected by this and then the mid set duet with Kirk and rob, this time Killers by Iron Maiden, but the sound affected it so much that wasn't really audible. I love Metallica and far from just wanting the classics. Id love anything from Death Magnetic or Load. But once they hit with One it seemed to flow so much better till the close. The sound was hit and miss at Twickenham, but then this is the same for Wembley, Ally Pally etc. Also the pitch is raised at Twickenham so view points from the general standing varied. Lastly the price point. I watched Tool play in Italy and paid �65 plus �40 to fly there. The same price for my standing ticket at Metallica. And I would say Tool blew this out the water. In summary a very good gig with some flaws .3/5. Still love them though :) "
Metallica,"Metallica has been a bucket list band for years.  I wish I could say they lived up to expectations.  Jim Breuer as an opening ""act"" fell flat.  He was more of a hype man with very little comedy. We could have easily lost the sing-a-long. There was 1 hour and 45 minutes between when Jim Breuer started his schtick to when Metallica took to the stage. Enough time that the crowd started getting antsy. While Metallica themselves sounded perfectly acceptable, they had sound issues.  The mixing was off, with very little audible bass, and there were several songs where James' vocals were all but undetectable. The mix of songs was good, but I could have done with fewer from Hardwired and more from Master of Puppets and ...And Justice for all.  So for me, they were just OK.  And I am sorry about that because I waited a long time to see them.  And Metallica fans... no reason to be such jerks.  I have never had a more negative fan experience in my life. "
Metallica,"From start to finish, Metallica played with passion and power through a great set list which included some real gems. James was his usual self interacting with the pumped up crowd. Lars was getting in on the act too, as every chance he got to leave his drums, he came over to us in the crowd and was shouting various things to whip us up even more. Robert and Kirk also had some fun, playing their version of 'warpigs' by 'Sabbath. Which got the majority of the crowd singing. A group drumming session was included during 'now that we're dead' which was awesome. They powered through the songs with some real 'beefy' bass and volume up to the point that during 'one' the PA system gave up and had to be re-set, much to the amusement of the crowd and the obvious annoyance of the band. But play on they did, and just seemed to get better as the night went on. Superb all round performance with a great crowd. Can't wait for them to return. "

Metallica,"TLDR: Epic. Now the longer version: It was great from A to Z. Went to the stadium when Ghost came on stage. They were pretty interesting to watch. I had a GA standing ticket. I happened to be lucky and found a place in the middle of the pitch, just at the back of the Golden Circle. It was a bit sad they had such a big premium area, but never mind. The Metallica show itself was epic. From the playlist to the sheer scale of the production, and the performance - every detail was taken care of. With 6 big screens, everyone could follow the action on stage. 2/3 into the show, they moved from the main stage to a smaller platform much closer to the crowd. Real Lords of the Summer London evening. Seek and Destroy set the crowd on fire. There was a real fire, fireworks and pyrotechnics I's expect from bands like Rammstein. Verdict- I'd see them again without hesitation. :D "
Metallica,"HANDS DOWN WAS ONE OF THE BEST PERFORMANCES I'VE EVER SEEN!!!!!!! THE SHOW WAS ABSOLUTELY FUCKING AMAZING!!!!!! THERE REALLY ARE NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE THE ENERGY AND THE FEELING OF BEING ABLE TO SEE THESE BANDS LIVE!!! BEING THERE FELT LIKE A DREAM COME TRUE!!! THE STAGE WAS FUCKIN SICK WITH ALL THE FIRE AND THE LASERS!!!! METALLICA KNOWS HOW TO MAKE A CROWD FEEL FUCKING ALIVE AND FEEL LIKE FAMILY!!!VOLBEAT AND METALLICA REALLY FUCKING KILLED IT!!!!! I COULD NOT HAVE ASKED FOR A BETTER SHOW!!!!!... and eventhough i was really disappointed that Avenged Sevenfold could not be there;I can definitely agree with James Hetfield's statement that ""Family always comes first"" and I wish the Avenged Sevenfold all the luck with the baby! I REALLY REALLY HOPE TO SEE VOLBEAT AND METALLICA AGAIN VERY SOON!!!!! I'm praying it doesn't take them more than a few years for them to return to Philly!!!!! "
Metallica,"This was my sixth time seeing Metallica, the first since the Black CD and by far their best performance yet.  The new album is great. The performances of Halo on Fire and Atlas Rise were great.  They played most of their best songs from the first five albums with only one song from Reload in Fuel.  I was a little surprised they didn't play Creeping Death which would have received a lot of fan participation.  If you can find a ticket and they are playing in your area you have to go. Avenged Sevenfold is a great opener and they played all their best stuff.  If I was disappointed in anything, it was the fact Local H opened the show and Bound for the Floor is the only song that ever did anything for them. I would have rather seen Volbeat, who performed in Houston with Metallica and Avenged Sevenfold.  Unbelievable show and a must see, you will not be disappointed. "
Metallica,"It was a perfect concert. It was my 16 year-old sons first time seeing Metallica. The nice summer heat,the full moon,Metallica played a lot of their old songs which really got the whole place into it. Then- there were the pyrotechnics/fireworks. O.M.G! Better than the 4th of July!! Metallica members really REALLY played-perfectly. They gave  SO much-I was in awe-they haven't aged a day....they have as much energy as they did 25 years ago. They were really professional and interacted with the fans. The fans on the other hand could have been more vocal and responsive. Metallica was absolutely amazing. AMAZING. They all look GREAT and I'm so glad to see them this successful after all these years. Good for them! The hard parts were the walking to and from the venue because parking sucks and the people who threw up. Jesus people, know your limits. "
Post Malone,"There were two different aspects of the concert. The crowd, and Post Malone himself. I am so disappointed in the everyone around me in the crowd. Over 20 people had to be pulled out because they had passed out because of alcohol, other substances, or being overcrowded or trampled. A boy had to be pulled out because his arm was snapped in half. I was almost pulled out because I felt like my ribs were going to break because of the pressure when people pushed forward. People kept pushing to the front, causing pain to everyone there, and they were rude while they did it. My friend and I lost our other friend and when we texted her she told us that a man tried to take her out of the venue. She needed help but we couldn't reach her. Again, the crowd was absolutely terrible. Post Malone himself did not come out until 40 minutes after he was supposed to because not everyone was in the venue. Him being late added to the frustration and pain I felt being slammed against the gate and squished between rude concert goers. Once he came on, the pushing and shoving did not cease but he was a great performer. I am glad I did not get pulled out. Although it was extremely painful he performed beautifully and it was 100% worth the pain. "
Post Malone,"I love Post Malone. Sadly his fans were such awful people we had to leave before he even came on. People were being crushed during the concert, people were passing out left and right and many people could barely breath. The fans were complete assholes about it to. People were shoving their way to the front (with people in the back already pushing you in so you can't back up) when there is absolutely no room to do so and then when you call them out and tell them there is no room they need to go back to the back they yell at you, cuss you out and then make fun of you. I personally saw at least 5 people pass out and as we left in disgust of the crowds behavior in the middle of the show we saw two ambulances in the back alley behind the venue helping several people who needed medical attention. I saw another review of his concert saying the same things. They even mentioned a guy broke his arm from being crushed and trampled. No matter how much I love Post Malone I wouldn't attend another of his concerts even if it were free. "
Post Malone,"I seen him yesterday 6/31/15 in Boston. I had front row stance. I was leaning on the sliver bench, any who. He was an amazing preformer. He gave us a great show hands down. Interactive with the crowd, dancing, usage of the whole stage ect. My down side unfortunately is that we spent more time waiting for him to preform than actually seeing him preform. As a fan, I expected the show not to last too long seeing as he is a blooming artist and all his songs got leaked, we knew what songs to expect. (He did forget to preform 'Holyfield') Back to the point, all in all, 3 hours wait for less than an hr performance. Not to mention a point in time we asked security to please move to the side so we can see he just shrugged his shoulders. I understand he has a job to do but we also paid to see post Malone and not the back of his shirt. Again, I loved his performance all in all. Can't wait til he's performing for thousands in a venues that's not a church lol Much love. A huge fan "
Post Malone,"The show itself was fantastic, but the venue was not that great. There was paid parking which was cheapest at 40 dollars. Leaving the venue was chaos as the streets were blocked off and traffic was at a standstill for a solid hour and a half (not exaggerating). Then there was the usual stuff with small restrooms (plus portapotties) and overpriced water down alcohol (20 for a small drink and 5 for water). I would not recommend this venue to anyone (Lakewood amp Cellairis). This is my second show at this venue and it seems to have gone downhill rapidly over a few years due to greed. Venue aside this was a great performance by 21 Savage and Post Malone (I missed the opener due to issues of finding parking somewhere that wasn�t extremely overpriced). "
Post Malone,"It was the best experience i've ever had. The show started with a dj after a short time a upcommimg star came. He made the fans go off. After an hour of performing, there was a break. Everyone was exited for Post Malone, but an other rapper came up. There wasnt much people who were excited to see him and the crowd has lost all patience. We wanted to see Post Malone! So half an hour of just chillimg, the lights turned off. We heard the start of ""Broken Whsikey Glass"" and every one flipped out. The man himself, Post Malone came out. I was so happy i had to jump. All of his songs were good but there were even better when its live performed. I will never forget this event and im happy that this was my very first comcert. Anel "
Post Malone,"Amazing performer. I didn't know what to expect since this was the first time I went to one of his concerts. I went for 21 savage but I knew some of his songs and I was excited. I can say that at the end of the concert he was MUCh more entertaining than 21. He was charismatic but calm. He had this happy and serious feeling and it was so chill but hype at the same time. it felt really personal when he pointed out people in the crowd, sang songs to us and performed his heart out. I definitely want to see him again now that I'm more familiar and know more of his songs. "
Post Malone,"Hello Austin, I just want to say that Chaz & I truly enjoyed getting to see your show and visit with you afterwards. Miles have kept us apart and from getting to knowing each other better, but see that your musical ventures in your life have created a very young talented and unique individual in its own right. I have watched you grow into the person you are today and hope you continue to strive in our journey to the top. Chaz and I would love to see you again when you are in the area...and God Bless!! Love, your Aunt Kim and Cousin Chaz. "
Post Malone,"It was probably one of the best nights of my life. He was so enthusiastic about the crowd, he loved our energy, said he wanted us to come on tour with him haha. But seriously I had an amazing time, I sat front row so I got to see my hero literally right in front of me AND he told me he loved me (which I got on record) as well as at the end of the concert he jumped off the railing into the crowd and I got to hug him, so yeah I�d say it was a pretty memorable night, I definitely know I�m gonna go to another one of his concerts again . "
Post Malone,"While Post didn't disappoint, he probably didn't excite as much as he should. His set, although filled with great tracks, was a tad short for my liking. His on stage presence felt a little boring at times, and failed to really make much of a connection with the crowd at all. It just felt like he wanted to play his songs and get the hell out. Not a bad show, but also given how much people were spending to see this guy, you'd figure'd there be something more. Maybe he's just tired though, which in that case, I wish him some rest. "
Post Malone,"The show was incredible!! Everything was lit and pumped got the crowd hyped and engaging!! Every single person who preformed was great and Posty was AMAZING live wow! However, the pauses in between the artists really killed the vibe!! Next time don�t have too long pauses inbetween people will just have to wait to go to the bathrooms/buy drinks. Or at least make sure something is entertaining meanwhile (just having a DJ playing or the cool light show or something) "
Post Malone,"Excellent show! Great views, great lights and sound, artists were engaging and energetic. We felt connected and like we were part of the energy. Post Malone is such an amazing artist - loved being able to see his emotions, his heart, and his dedication. Post, I don't know who hurt you in the past, but I love you and wish I could just give you a hug.  Had a fantastic time! Keep doing you and own it like you do...your fans adore you! "
Post Malone,"One of the best concerts I�ve been to. The lineup was stacked and the music was great. Post and 21 were a little far away but that�s how it is at shoreline, you get a lot of energy from the crowd so it doesn�t matter. If you haven�t been to shoreline know that uber surge pricing is insane after the concert and everyone walks to the in n out a mile away so get there early. Overall a fantastic time 10/10 "
Post Malone,"Altjough probably one of the oldest fans there (53), I absolutely loved this show. True stars are few and far between these days but Posty comes across as not only hugely talented, but also honest,raw and lovable. His rapport with the crowd of adoring fans was palpable. He never missed a note and was delightful with what he shared with us. I wish him every future success and happiness. What a gig! "
Post Malone,"Wonderful!!!Post does not disappoint!  He sang fabulously.  I saw the concert at the Toyota Pavilion in Irving, TX.  I got pit passes & loved being up close.  There was plenty of space to move to the back & listen if the crowd became overwhelming.  I have already purchased tickets to his next Dallas area performance!  Paris opened for him & he was an unexpected delight!  Definitely worth going!!! "
Post Malone,"The show at the PNC Music Pavilion was amazing! Post Malone did an amazing job! Even though it was raining for the first part of the performance, he did so well that it was definitely worth standing in the rain! I would have stood in the snow to see this performance!Post Malone is the best artist out there and I have confidence that he will make it big! He did excellent! "
Post Malone,"6/2/17 @ The Novo Theater was AMAZING! Post Malone is a great performer and his voice live is the next best thing!. Biggest thanks to Post and his crew for coming to LA and performing, it was one of the most memorable nights in my life. Concert revenue was great, and as my first concert experience being right infront of the stage my night was epic. Thank you Posty!! "
Post Malone,"Amazing concert, could feel his �nice-ness� radiating into the crowd. Loved when he played Stay especially, and then proceeded to break his guitar a few songs later hahaah. The crowd was hyped all-round for him, and the opening acts were pretty good too! Would just be better if they don�t keep on promoting themselves between every song "
Post Malone,"Purchased the no wait inline tickets, got to the place at around 8:45, was still waiting in some line for about an hour or +. Waited until around 12:30 to see this guy but he never showed up... I was disappointed. Tonight he was more Ghost Malone rather than... Probably won't purchase any other ticket for this guy... "
Post Malone,"Post Malone's concert was the most amazing experience. I will remember this for the rest of my life. He sounded amazing live, the songs were perfect, the crowd was in awe. The effects were to die for. Overall, highlight of my life to the point where the merch was sick, and his support acts were amazing "
Post Malone,"Went to post Malone's concert on Sunday the 5th of May and, it was amazing! The crowd was jumping around and singing along and the affects were spectacular. I came in a but late but managed to get a pretty decent view of him. Next time Post Malone comes I'm definitely going. "
Sam Smith,"Sam Smith; the guy with the BEST male vocals in the UK right now    Well what can i say. I have every respect and love in the world for this guy. For starters, the presence he brings to the stage just as he walks on, before he�s even began to sing. The crowds cheer and arms in the air just shows what he means to all.    So, some may say that it wasn�t necessarily the gig they bought tickets for considering that we only found out there and then that it was all going to be streamed live everywhere, but he definitely brought it home with what i would say was an 11/10 performance. His passion shines through in each and every song and you just don�t want the night to end and stop his soothing voice. You know how it is after a concert the come down is the worst part especially after any performance like that.    I must mention the support act �Richie and the Remedy� who were amazing also. I�d never heard of them before but the voice that Richie Skint carries and the picking skills that Harvey Lee showed definitely left me wondering when they�re next performing and fingers crossed it�s near me! Definitely a band that should be shouted about more.    Everyone likes to think that the artist up there on stage gave them a little look out of the 100s of people surrounding them but Sam Smith never failed to cover the entire audience and give his cheeky little smile. I�ve seen him perform before, once with �Disclosure� and once with, local lad for me, �Naughty Boy�. Again just an amazing show and to see him go from roughly a 3 minute performance to a whole performance dedicated for him is such an awesome thing to witness.I knew that i had to get the tickets as soon as i found out about the gig but back then he wasn�t so well known and most definitely became known at the perfect time for this gig.    I think credit where credit is due and that�s down to �Disclosure� for finding this hidden gem in the midst of the music industry today thanks to his exceptional track �Lay Me Down�. Also a thanks should go to �Naughty Boy� for featuring Sam on his track �La La La� which ultimately broke him through the final barriers of the music industry.    One of the best things about the night was the little surprises he had lined up for us. Out of nowhere comes Jessie Ware to join him in 'Leave Your Lover'. With a voice like an angel, together they had the place stunned. Another of the surprises, a bit later on, brought out Howard from Disclosure to play 'Make It To Me' on the keys. The amount of talent the artists and bands seem have these days never ceases to amaze me. So what a talent, and from his personal experiences have come the most stunning tracks i�ve heard and it�s amazing how his voice and compositions make you share his feelings and it almost makes you feel as though you know him. I must admit i�ve shed a tear to many of his songs and i�m not ashamed to say!    What a thanks to Sam Smith and all the success is wished to him by everyone i can imagine. If you ever get the chance, even if you�ve seen him before, go and see him for yourself and I can promise you that you won't regret it.    By Amba Pattison "
Sam Smith,"First of March I went to see Sam Smith at Forest National, Brussels. I really liked Sam his way of performing and his voice has a great sound, although I have some things to say that made this concert experience a bit less enjoying as I thought it would be. Sam had a few minor slips (for example a very few high/low notes or endings), but you can definitely hear that he has a beautiful voice. Him not singing the phrase 'money on my mind' the whole song, but letting the crowd do it, did let me down a bit. I didn't hear all this qualities of singing here. He is an enthusiast and open hearted with the crowd, which does give a good vibe. I like his way of performing! And the back up vocals were beautiful as well. I was negatively surprised about the quality of acoustics at Forest National, it was terrible. I couldn't hear whatever Sam was singing for like 65% of his songs. Also, the possibility to park here is horrible, so they promote you to come with public transport. But, at the end of the concert, you are lucky to get back where you came from. Everyone is trying to get on that bus or tram, again, terrible. Really. We walked for at least 4 stopt, to be able to hop on another tram that went to Brussels Midi. "
Sam Smith,"I saw Sam Smith at U Street Music Hall and I fell in love with his music all over again. The concert took place before his debut album was released so we weren't sure what to expect. Most of the songs he performed that night were from his new album. No one knew the words to the songs but EVERY song he performed was AMAZING! His voice was PERFECT! Sam Smith has a beautiful and soulful voice. His voice is so pure. I absolutely love this guy. I have not loved an artist like this since Adele. He really is the male version of the Adele, which is an incredible compliment. I want him to do well in music since, according to his Twitter bio, he singe for his supper (teehee). However, I don't ever want him to turn his back on small venues. I don't have a single complaint. I'm going to another one of his concerts later this year, the venue is bigger but it's not a stadium so hopefully it won't take away from the intimacy of the show. After the show was over, we chanted his name and he came back and gave us an encore performance. If you have a chance to go see him, you absolutely should. He is a truly talented vocalist and writer. "
Sam Smith,"Where do I begin with Sam Smith? Do I start with the gorgeous stage presentation or the flawless blend of his background vocalists? Maybe with his grand entrance and flawless vocals? I think I'll start with Sam, the person. From the moment he walked on stage, he was gracious, humble, and genuinely thrilled that we were all there to see him and even more honored by the screaming and cheering that pervaded his ears. There are not enough adjectives to adequately describe how flawless and enrapturing his performance was! Every note, every run, was perfectly in tune and blew me away. It was like listening to his album�except better!    I have know that everyone else in the audience was just as in awe as I was. We were in the presence of musical greatness and I have no doubt that Sam Smith is going to be on the forefront of music for a long time to come! I'm already waiting by my computer hoping that Songkick will tell me that he's coming back to my town. "
Sam Smith,"This concert was absolutely amazing! First Kwabs came on stage and made a good start, with his famous song ""Walk"" where the audience started dancing. But when Sam Smith came on stage, the audience exploded! With his strong, unique voice he brought us to smiles and tears. He did some danceable songs, and asked to sing with him, like in the songs ""Like I can"", ""La la la"" and ""Money on my mind"". He talked about the stories behind the songs, his past and his homosexuality. Although the beginning was great, the best part still had to come. That's the moment when he starts singing his ballads en slower songs, with his powerfull voice. My personally favorite was the accoustic version of ""Latch"", but also ""Leave your lover"" and ""Lay me down"" were incredible! And of course the show ended with a great version of ""Stay with me"", when everyone sung as hard as they could. A day never to forget, and I'll be there when he comes back to Belgium! "
Sam Smith,"This was the best concert I have seen to date!  You see the last time I saw a show coming to town I got ""scalped"" really bad on my tickets.  So in laymen's terms, I actually got ripped off really badly for tickets.  I paid so much for really bad seats.  But this time at the Sam Smith Concert, Songkick got me direct with the original seller, and I was able to buy the tickets of my dreams with my favorite artist of all time! I was right there in the front listening to Sam Smith sing all of the songs from his amazing album, and was also able to listen to his amazing story and personal experiences connected to his truly personal and meaningful music.  It was truly and experience of a lifetime, Sam Smith or Songkick did not dissappoint. It was an amazing night with an amazing performer, and I will never forget that night. "
Sam Smith,"This concert was absolutely amazing! His voice was so angelic and he was so genuine and humble. Every time he smiled it melted my heart because you could tell how grateful he was and how much he loves his life and it was just so beautiful! Everyone was there to just have a good time and everyone was singing along and it was such an incredible environment. One of the best moments was when someone from the crowd threw a rainbow flag on the stage during his song �HIM� and he took it a waved it around while everyone cheered in support of gay rights, it was so amazing. He is so inspiring and honestly my favorite artist. This was hands down the best concert I�ve ever been to, and I never wanted it to end. One of the best nights of my life. "
Sam Smith,"Sam Smith was my first ever concert I've attended and let me tell you I was not disappointed in the least. Not only is his voice even better live than it is on his album, but he is also the most down to earth, honest, and adorable person ever. Throughout the concert he kept taking time out to talk about his songs and the meaning behind them as well. Due to it being my first concert I don't know if this is a normal thing, but Sam also thanked the crowd after every song which I thought was incredibly endearing and made you feel genuinely appreciated for coming to see him. Overall I can say it was one of the best nights of my life and will 100% be getting tickets the next time he's in town. "
Sam Smith,"Everything about the show was amazing, ypu touch everyone in the auditorium. The songs you decided to sing were excellent and the feeling you put to every song you showed it in your eyes. After every song you smiled to the public and that made us more excited to be there and sometimes put tiers of excitement in our eyes.  We could all related to your songs in different ways. You are an  inspiration to me. I'm so happy I got the opportunity to see you after the show and get your autograph in my ticket and sweatshirt. That night it's going to be unforgettable for every person that was there that night and the night before. Hope I have the opportunity to see you again here in Mexico City. "
Sam Smith,"Sam Smith was a powerhouse last night at MSG. I have been in the music business for quite some time now and I can honestly say I have never been witness to such pure talent on stage. His vocal performance put shame to whats been recorded and his band behind him was a driving force unmatched. From start to finish it was a mesmerizing experience, and might I add, Disclosure showing up was a pleasant surprise. I look forward to what might be next for Mr. Smith and how he may plan to grace the music industry in the future. If your're considering going to a show, just go ahead and buy a ticket...you won't be disappointed. "
Sam Smith,"I have been to so many concerts this year but this was hands down the best one. I have never heard so much energy from a crowd in between songs, not to mention that his voice sounds even better in person, which I didn�t know was possible! The VERTICAL SCREENS are revolutionary!! Everyone does widescreen because that�s what the industry knows but this was amazing, loved seeing new forms of the industry! Phenomenal show, from the lights, to the stage set up, to the camera men and of course to the voices on stage well done.Keep up the good work. Hope to see you again soon -Calgary, Canada "
Sam Smith,"Absolutely amazing concert! Never in my 33 year old lige have I heard a voice quite like Sam Smiths. He sounds even better live than he does on the record! Betweeen som of the songs he told us a little bit about the meaning behind the songs, and it was beautiful. It's hard to belive that such a young guy can be so talented both regarded to songwriting and singing those amazing songs. I look forward to be enjoying a lot more concerts with the wonderful Sam Smith in the future! It was definitly worth the 7 hour drive from our home in Denmark to Cologne, Germany :) Love from Jannie, Denmark "
Sam Smith,"This was an electric group experience. Having listened to this album on repeat for a few months now, I'm pleasantly surprised to say that the live performances are better. While ""In the Lonely Hour"" is high on production, SS took it to vocal basics, slowing a few songs down to really show off his voice. Rare (in my experience) to see someone take the time to talk you through how their songs came about, and he was good about pausing to give little peeks into the process. Whole room was spell bound, amazing time. "
Sam Smith,"Absolutely amazing show in Seattle. He looked so cute and genuinely happy on the stage. Voacals were out of this world. I was expecting to be singing really loud and belting along with all the songs, but for most of them the audience was almost silent, just quietly singing to ourselves, not wanting to overpower his amazing voice. Set design was minimal yet intimate. All around wonderful, one of the most beautiful concerts i�ve been to "
Sam Smith,"Definitely the best concert I have ever been to! I wanted to see him live for sooo long and yesterday I finally had the chance to. The artist that played before him is very talented and funny, and everyone was on time. I really liked that Sam sung to everyone of us, he looked everywhere in the stadium and entertained each person. I am sure that everybody liked it, would certainly watch him live again ( maybe not only once again :) ) "
Sam Smith,"What an amazing night! The musicians, the design of the stage, the song arrangements and of course, the wonderful way in which Sam Smith makes the whole experience so intimate for each person without forgetting to make us come together while singing his songs. I would recommend this concert to anyone. Even if you�re not crazy about him or his music, I bet you will still have a great time. That man knows how to put on a show. "
Sam Smith,"Saw Sam in Birmingham, and have to say, I was enthralled by the whole concert. From the moment it started, all through to the end, it was truly amazing!!! His voice was pure and perfect! The whole atmosphere was electric, each and every song felt as if it was being sung to every person on a personal level! His presence was huge and the whole arena were gripped by each and every note! I would go see him again without hesitation. "
Sam Smith,"This was my first ever concert of Sam Smith. It was worth every penny! His voice, his songs, the show, his personality, just everything was amazing! He definitely is one of the best singers of today. His voice, just WOW, absolutely WOW. There are no other words to describe how incredible his voice is! It's even better than on record! When Sam is coming back, I will definitely be there when (like) I can. "
Fall Out Boy,"Fall Out Boy was all I ever dreamed of and more. Patrick, Pete, Joe, and Andy all did an amazing job. They come out with a bang LITERALLY. They had fire shooting in the air when they came out. In between every couple of their songs Pete Wentz would say an inspiring message that would raise your self confidence or get you fired up about life then at the end of his message he would say a lyric that had to do with what he was saying then they would instantly jump into that song. The lights were astounding especially at the end when it rained sparks. Speaking of lights on one of their songs Patrick had everyone in the stadium especiallythose on the lawn raise a light while they sang, it was breath taking it looked like a giant body of stars shining and moving together to the beat of ""Just one yesterday"". This is definitely a concert to take your parents to because at one point Pete came out and said his dad always hated his concerts because he didn't know any of the songs so they played ""We are the champions"" while Patrick dramatically rose from under the stage with a piano and after that went straight into ""Save rock and roll"". After about the first five songs there was a intermission like thing, but instead of elevator music Andy and Patrick were rolled onto the stage with drum sets and had a fucking drum war to the beat of some remixed collage of rap songs and it was absolutely stunning watching them go back and forth. Patrick was smiling so wide I thought his cheeks were going to explode. I've been listening to Fall Out Boy since I was in 6th grade and rocking out to ""I Don't Care"" every day when I came home from kids ignoring me. Fall Out Boy has an amazing message they put into every album. They write the battles of their souls and make it to where you can dance or scream along to get rid of all your sorrow or at least have strength to fight it. Every song has a beautiful way with words that lights a fire down within you to keep pushing and fight for what you believe in until your last breath. They inspire so many with only an album of words at a time and that is a talent not many possess. "
Fall Out Boy,"Fall Out Boy... While their music has changed over the years, each album is just as good as the first, if not better. They have really stayed true to their rock and roll image and sound. Going to a Fall Out Boy concert takes you back in time to the very first time you ever heard their music. It's like 2008 never ended! Words cannot describe the experience you will have at their show, I have seen them twice in concert and this last concert was definitely better than the first. Fall Out Boy knows how to put on a show! Lead singer, Patrick Stump, jumps and dances around the stage for two hours and never misses a note. Pete Wentz's guitar/bass skills will leave you speechless. Fall Out Boy is so dedicated to their music that they rarely ever stop the show to talk - they play music almost nonstop. Fall Out Boy uses the coolest special effects in their shows. Ranging from fire, to fireworks, to a demon that's trying to destroy rock and roll, they will not disappoint your expectations.    They really care about their fans too. They asked how many parents were in the crowd and he said his dad used to take him to rock concerts and the drive home was always awkward because his dad never knew any of the songs the band would play. So to combat the awkward car ride home, they did a cover of a song EVERYBODY knows- ""We Are The Champions."" They also take a picture with the crowd at every show to make sure they don't forget the night in the jumble of shows they do. The boys really know how to work a crowd. Pete crowd surfed while Andy and Patrick had a guitar battle at the end of the show. They always leave the crowd with an encouraging and positive message, which is greatly appreciated. You will not be disappointed if you attend one of their shows! "
Fall Out Boy,"I've seen Fall Out Boy twice in my short lifetime, and on both occasions it was magical beyond belief. To say that I was blissed-out would be a tremendous understatement. The boys, as usual did a great job, played their songs amazingly and connected well with the audience. Their acoustic renditions of songs ""Young Volcanoes"" and ""Immortals"" were especially pleasant, and the angst-rock pop-punk teenage-trouble anthem ""I Don't Care"" was a mega crowd pleaser. While their set may have been a tad short for my liking, it was wonderful all the same and incredibly entertaining, with short-film type things in the gap between some songs. The light show was epic, with the band literally coming in and out with a bang. During many songs there were flames shooting behind them (light em up, up, up...) and fireworks were even preset during the ever-amazing song ""Alone Together"" off of their 2013 album ""Save Rock And Roll"". Although Fall Out Boy was the headliner (and honestly, the reason I payed to see the concert), their special guest on the Boys Of Zummer tour, Wiz Khalifa, was also a great addition to the concert and a large part of why I had such a good time. Not being a rap fan myself, I was pleasantly surprised at my enjoyment of Khalifa's set. It was especially entertaining when (during his hit song ""Young, Wild, and Free"") he threw the crowd giant inflatable blunts to toss around and dance with. MAX was also present, and I either missed an earlier set of his OR he only preformed one song (that being in between the Wiz Khalifa and Fall Out Boy set.)... Which, regardless of length, was really cool. I wouldn't miss seeing Fall Out Boy live for the world, and needless to say, buying tickets is a very good investment. :) "
Fall Out Boy,"Fall Out Boy has been my favorite band since I was a Junior in High School back in '03. They're an all-around amazing band, and their live shows are even better, which is why I keep going back for more. Fall Out Boy has never disappointed me, their stage presence and ability to get the crowd super hyped is off the charts. In the many shows I have been to, no one has ever gotten music fans more excited about the whole concert experience than Fall Out Boy. Although I have always preferred seeing them at a small venue rather than a large arena, either way they sound phenomenal and perform amazingly live. From Patrick's majestic vocals, to Pete's ability to get the girls (and guys) riled up with just a smile, to Andy's insane skills as a drummer and Joe's fabulous hair swishing about as he shreds his guitar, I can guarantee it'll be a show that you'll hold with you forever. The stages are never really super elaborate, but its always just enough to add a bit of flair to their set. I remember in 2005 on the Nintendo Fusion tour, the entire band wore prep school uniforms during their set. That small detail just made the experience a thousand times more awesome to watch. The guys deserve every bit of fame they have. I have met Patrick (actually he signed my arm and I got his signature tattooed from the 11/11/2007 show in Virginia) and Pete outside of the venues, and they are both just genuinely super nice guys and you get the vibe that they really appreciate you coming out to see them. During the shows they always take time to thank their fans in between songs, and it makes you feel really special. So next time they come around, you better go or you'll be making the biggest mistake of your life! "
Fall Out Boy,"Overall this was a great concert. Fall Out Boy had a fantastic set and the atmosphere was awesome. The audio mixing was a little rough at times, with some songs having completely unintelligible vocals, being drowned out by an overly high bass mix and having everything mixed too close to redline. I would back it all off a notch and the bass maybe two so that the music comes across at a higher quality. The Struts were interesting, great performance even if I didn't know most of their songs. New Politics was a surprise hit with a wonderful performance, good mixing, and great songs. Bastille was a good performance overall. The stage seemed a little crowded for them due to FOB's equipment behind them. Their audio had some hiccups at times, sounding robotic when it shouldn't have. Otherwise the music was great. The biggest problem I had with their set was the lighting. For the majority of the set their lights were aimed directly into our seats, preventing us from seeing anything, let alone their performance. Part of this is the design on the venue, but their show should have been adapted to that. AWOLNation was underwhelming, all in all I would say the worst performance of the night. Their sound was of poor quality and the performance was just not that great overall. If I had the chance I would not buy tickets to one of their shows. If I were to produce the show, I would have cut AWOLNation and given FOB a longer time to play. They were the real crowd pleasers with AWOLNation simply an afterthought to most concert goers. "
Fall Out Boy,"When I heard that Fall Out Boy was going on tour, I knew I had to go see them no matter what! I absolutely love FOB, and have been dying to see them live!!!! <3 Getting tickets was such a suspense because they sold so fast, but I managed to nab one of the last GA Floor tickets which I was super stoked about. Then the question was how I was going to get to Hollywood FL all the way from the Tampa area since I don't have a car. (Merely a minor technicality lol ;) ) Ended up driving down with a friend so that was great. Met some awesome people while waiting in line to go in Then the concert itself. Well it goes without saying that FOB were absolutely incredible!!! The show was amazing and Patrick, Pete, Joe and Andy are such talented and awesome people!!!! I was up on the barricade on Pete's side, and he was literally right there in front of me!!!!! Still can't believe that I was actually there and actually saw them! When they were coming out on stage, there was a picture of a mountain and then from the ceiling bubble bits of foam came floating down over the whole arena.FOB made it snow in Florida!!!! It was magical, the magic of FOB. All the lights and special effects were so good! Then for the cherry on top of the whole experience, I managed to get a guitar pick (after some shameless begging hahahaha). :D Yep, great concert, great band, can't wait for the next time!!! "
Fall Out Boy,"The last show of the Save Rock and Roll era was just as amazing as the rest (if not better)! It was the only Monumentour show without Paramore, so I got to see more of just Fall Out Boy, which was great as I'm not a huge Paramore fan. After a very talented opening by New Politics, Fall Out Boy played a selection of their best songs: some hits like ""thnks fr th mmrs"" and ""My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark"", and also variety from each album, including less popular ones, which is really unusual compared to a lot of bands, who often play songs only fr the newest album. One thing that really made this show memorable were Pete's tear-inducing speeches throughout the show. He is an amazing speaker as well as lyricist and bassist for the band! Patrick's Elton John impression in Save Rock and Roll was hilarious (but also very accurate). And   when it came to their last song, they ended with what seems to be a tradition-- ""Saturday"". It's a song from their first official album about the band and their rise to fame, with lyrics like ""me and Pete..."", which really captured the feel of the band and and gave us hope that there might be another album coming soon... After that, the crowd started chanting ""Centuries"" (which is their new single) in hope that they would play it, but they didn't. All in all, it was an absolutely amazing concert and all I want is to go back and do it again! "
Fall Out Boy,"Fall Out Boy is my second favorite band. I grew up listening to their music. I'm 15, and I've been a fan for 8 years. After 8 years of waiting to see them live, I finally got to see them live at the Boys Of Zummer tour in Chicago with Wiz Khalifa, Hoodie Allen, MAX, and DJ Drama. The concert was great, but there was a lot of people, teenagers, smoking pot and passing joints. Luckily it was an outdoor venue so the smoke aired out easier but it smelled so bad of smoke, especially when Wiz was playing. People kept shoving my friend and I around because they were high and wasted. They were overall obnoxious. When Fall Out Boy took the stage, it started pouring down rain, which was fine because we were all hot and humid and it was in general just a lot of fun. People who were smoking left because Wiz was done with his set, which was nice so we could all actually breathe. I was more than amazed over FOB's set. The only thing is was that it seemed way too short. Before I knew it, it was all over! I guess I was having too much fun. But to anyone who attended the Boys of Zummer tour, don't you feel like Wiz Khalifa played longer than Fall Out Boy? I feel like they did. Anyway, great show despite the things I mentioned before and it was a dream come true for me :) I'd recommend taking all your friends/family to a FOB show because you'd all have a blast. There's my review! Thanks! X "
Fall Out Boy,"Really great gig. The O2 was overpriced as always and badly organised. We missed the very first support band but against the current were pretty energetic and fun. Fall Out Boy, burst onto the stage with a lot of energy and pyrotechnics. I did however feel a little disengaged with them, but I think that is just what you get from stadium shows. The crowd was unusual to me as there wasnt a whole lot of ""rock"" fans so not the normal hustle and bustle, moshing or jumping. Just a lot of people standing about and singing. It was disappointing to learn that Pete sings a lot less in person than I though he did. But generally a good gig, personally however I am glad that the ticket was a gift because if I had paid full price for that level of energy I would have been a bit annoyed. It was the end of the tour so I understand that its tiring af, so not truly upset. Really weird that for ""champion"" a song I had not yet heard that they had an entire montage about princess Dianna. Wrong generation there buddy. And to show ""driving"" and crash footage just seemed a little messed up. I dont know. And to follow that with a song with the words crash in it, again, seemed weird. Overall, interesting show, I would see them again but perhaps only at a festival. Little lacking in energy but hey, they still came all this way to play. "
Fall Out Boy,"The first time I saw Fallout Boy was when I was going on their Momentour with Paramore. Now , originally I had heard about them but I didn't want to try the music, but with the concert I was kinda forced. And I enjoyed every second of it! They earned themselves a brand new fan! Their breaks and the dramatic drop in beats and Patricks voice! The drumming was also memorable especially when they came out with a drumming battle from the middle of nowhere. I downloaded all the songs they played and more! Their lyrics are so meaningful and the pictures on the screens in the background when they were performing were very interesting. But they certainly didn't distract from the performance! Now I'm aching till they're back in town and the first thing I'm gonna do is buy a ticket! I'm very picky with my music but their words and the music caught my attention, it's also very catchy and I found myself singing aloud multiple times... I also loved the clothes they wore expecially Patrick's hat. I can't compare this concert to many cause I haven't been to many but I'm so glad I stayed and heard them, They were the absolute highlight of my summer and I recommend going to see them, even if you're new and didn't know any words to any songs (like me) you should go anyway you won't regret it. "
Fall Out Boy,"I am so late to this but I figured I might as well write. So, my mom and I got to the venue hella early (for no actual reason, I don't even know why. We're just used to GA, I guess) and we were just sitting around while people got in line for M&G. I was actually in the process of asking my mom to go to Zombie Burger and just chill there for a while when this radio DJ signaled us to come over. My mom told me to stay where I was, and after about a minute of talking to him, she actually squealed and signaled for me to get all of our stuff and come over. Turns out the station he DJs for held a contest to win free M&G, and there were a few no-shows, so he wanted to give them to us. Why? I have no idea. he had four tickets, so he told two other girls to come over and gave them wristbands, as well. At this point I was near tears and thanking the guy profusely. So yeah, I totally randomly got M&G for Fall Out Boy. I still have no idea how I was so lucky. It's kind of funny, too, because my mom wanted to stay home for a few more hours (we had a 3 hour drive to get to the venue) and I insisted we left because I always get really anxious if we're not super early to a concert (again, it's because of how many GA shows I've been too). TL;DR, always show up to concerts early, kids. "
Fall Out Boy,"I saw FOB during their Wintour is Coming tour in March, and I was singing every word. Pete was funny, Andy had his shirt off (duh) and Patrick sung his heart out. Joe was there too, oh yeah. They played all of my favorite songs off of Infinity on High, pretty much everything on American Psycho, a couple off songs off of Save Rock and I dont care off of Folie a Deux. The tour was really to promote Irresistible, which is what they opened with. They ended with Centuries and Saturday. AWOLNATION was amazing as well, but I didn't really like the other opening act, forget who it was. Had seats close up to the front, but the girl behind me only knew Centuries and her friend had to consistently tell her what the song was. They played Weezer, P!ATD, and Sia videos before the concert on the big screens, but no FOB videos. Overall an amazing experience. I'm hoping to see them again sometime. 9.5/10. Not really for kids, as everytime Pete talked, he managed to slip in at least ten curse words. "
Fall Out Boy,"Watching my favourite band perform live was the most incredible experience. It was my first concert (normally I go to festivals) and it was fantastic. I'll admit, that I was disappointed with the first act, Charley Marley. His/their? music was unoriginal and generic, and Charley clearly thought that he was more famous than he was. Matt and Kim interacted well with the audience, made us laugh and dance, and Professor Green had everyone singing along. As a lifelong fan of FOB, it was a significant moment, when they came on stage, and the crowd responded enthusiastically throughout the entire hour and a half. The set was varied, and interesting, with a range of songs from their old albums and new one - American beauty/physco. They were even better live than I had anticipated, and the atmosphere of the entire concert was awesome. I would definitely definitely recommend seeing FOB live. I know I would jump at the opportunity to see them again. "
Fall Out Boy,"I've been such a huge fan of Fall Out Boy since I was about 12 years old and although it's taken 10 years for me to finally attend a concert the wait was definitely worth it. Watching them was a dream true come true and I can only imagine the middle-schooler in me jumping for joy.  Their selection of songs was so on point and I'm glad that they mixed it up with songs from different albums. ""We Are Are The Champions"" was a great touch to appease the older people in the crowd who accompanied the youngins.  I honestly really loved the talks to the audience. Fall Out Boy is fully aware of how influential they are and that there are many young people in their fan base so it meant a lot to hear them speak out to not only them but to their older fans who also need inspiration to hear that it can get better and to not give up.    Thanks for an incredible show. I love you guys and I can't wait to see you guys perform again. "
Fall Out Boy,"It was fucking awesome. Dude, when MGK jumped off the stage and ran through the path I was like this is so cool. the streamer bomb and the shooting fire and legit indoor fireworks and all the rest of the special effects were amazing, almost as amazing as when they got on top of the jumbotrons and rode them up. their drummer's hands are so fast it was just a blur. Specifically, I came especially for Machingunkelley but also lowkey loved falloutboy, but that concert like hyped up my fandom level to like an 11 (idk if it was even possible but major increase in fanhood for MGK too ;P). It was so cool and it was the best first concert I could've had. I even loved their opener band, usually those opening bands lowkey suck (inthevideosI'veseen), but they were really good! I loved the whole experience even though our seats weren't the best, couldn't have asked for a better birthday present. "
Fall Out Boy,"This was only my second concert so I wasn't too sure what to expect, but this concert was awesome! The show started almost exactly on time and the opening acts were PVRIS and AWOLNATION. I was not familiar with PVRIS but they were great and I am a new fan. They performed for about 30 minutes and were very engaging with the crowd. AWOLNATION started about 15 minutes later and played for about 30 minutes also. They really got the crowd going and were very entertaining (even starting the wave) and saved their biggest hit last (Sail). About 20 minutes later, Fall Out Boy came out and were incredible. They went back and forth between old favorites and songs from their new album and interacted with the audience throughout the whole show (they were on stage for roughly an hour and a half). I would absolutely go to another of their shows (and would return to this venue as well). "
Fall Out Boy,"I've already seen fall out boy 3 time and each time they deliver! Patrick stumps vocals are out of this world and so real. I love the variations between the studio and real life. I know some people like their entertainers to sound exactly like the record but I love the voice cracks and when they hit a note too high and they're voice shakes. They had fire, confetti, streamers, lasers, sparklers. EVERYTHING I wanted. I could feel the heat of the fire I could see the passion when they play. It was so entertaining! The background of the stage had visuals that were so interesting to look at. They tributed to  Colin Kaepernick and Princess Diana just made the concert ALL the more real to me.  The community was welcoming and so kind and everyone was jamming to their own beat. I  HIGHLY recommend if you're still contemplating to buy a ticket. "
Fall Out Boy,"Going to the Monument Tour was something I will never forget. The entire concert was beyond amazing. The effects were spectacular, the T-shirt cannon was awesome, the people around we're amazing, but nothing compares to the actual performers. New Politics definitely put on a show. If you didn't know who they were you wanted to. You were compelled to. Paramore actually pulled a girl from the audience to sing on stage with them. And Fall Out Boy? They were the definition of perfection. They got into every one of their songs adding something personal to each. They interacted with the fans, and just made you feel like YOU belonged there. It was an experience I wouldn't have missed for the world and I loved every minute of it. All I can tell you is; If you get the chance to go to the monument tour, take it. Take it and don't look back. "
Fall Out Boy,"It's the morning after and I'm EXHAUSTED.  The set list was amazing; they came out in bursts of flame with The Phoenix and kept the energy going the entire hour and a half.  They used the extended stage and rising podiums at the Barclays Center to great effect, whether it was Joe, Pete and Pat running up and down the ramp to hovering above the audience and tossing guitar picks into the crowd.  Patrick was dancing around like he was just having the time of his life!!  The show ended strong with three encore songs and shirts floating down into the audience via parachutes/merch bags. Oh, and the llama monsters made an appearance.  My life is complete! Awesome show! The venue could have used more vegetarian options, but that's on not FOB.  Can't wait for the new album :D :D "
Fall Out Boy,"What is there to expect from Fall Out Boy?! Well for starters it's an amazing and extremely talented band that have been through it all together and manage to still make fans go crazy! Fall Out Boy's live shows are full of excitement and adrenaline! In my opinion, the most memorable moment is when everyone is so eager for their favorite band to come out and when you see the lights go out, everyone cheers as loud as they can and a mass full of strangers become one as we all move closer to our favorite band or artist! This is a for sure for Fall Out Boy live shows! Everyone is there for one reason and one reason only, to make dreams come true of seeing their favorite band live. Fall Out Boy is a must see if you want the full experience of what a true concert feels like! "
Snoop Dogg,"I was pretty worried that the concert might've been uncomfortable, as I'm a teen that went with their parents. Also, my mom isn't good at keeping her calm in situations surrounded by high intensity and tons of weed (which I guarantee will be at any Snoop concert). But it was the opposite of awkward. It was really fucking fun and people of all ages and backgrounds were there. We sat in the mezzanine, and even that far away from the stage it was high energy and a great vibe. HYPE Everyone was feeling the music and yes, there was shitloads of marijuana, even in a fancy theater venue like the Paramount in Seattle.  But it's not overwhelming at all, even if you don't smoke. No one's aggressive or anything of the sort or passing judgement. Everybody's there to flip out over Snoop Dogg, dance, sing their hearts out, and have a good time. Snoop was so charismatic, captivating, and comfortable onstage. He never missed a beat or messed up his lyrics and put on a great show. I lost all inhibition dancing, and I'm usually self-conscious and anxious. Tons of fun. There were about five different groups opening, which lasted around three and a half hours (Puff Puff Pass Tour Part 2). Snoop was up there for about an hour and a half. He finished with Young, Wild & Free and spoke about all the hatred in the world in its current situation and how his tour was all about empathy, peace, and love and to stay strong. It was honestly beautiful. The show closed with Bob Marley's jamming. My clothes and hair still smelled like weed the day after. Definitely a must-see. "
Snoop Dogg,"Thought the show was very entertaining! Snoop's got a great legacy and his story is definitely worthy of a play (and a movie as well, which we know will happen). Tamar Braxton was perfect as the Angel and WOW was really impressed with La Toya London's performance! Thought physically Lil JJ was too short to play Snoop but he very much acted the part and won me over. Oh and the visuals and sound effects were great too. Every time I heard gunshots I actually turned to make sure it wasn't real. LOL!!! So my only critique was it ran a little long, thought his story could have been told in less time. Other than that great job by everyone, cast, crew, the band. Oh and forgot how much I despise the seating arrangement at Microsoft Theater. Rows are too long so if you're seated in middle seats you have to scoot by at least 10-14 people to get to your seat, annoying! Also people actually brought infants and small children. This is not a good place to bring children. Hire a babysitter! This along with the high ticket price, convenience charge, taxes and parking fees are probably why I will consider not going here again. "
Snoop Dogg,"Okay, who doesn't love Snoop Dogg? Maybe my grandma, but otherwise, I can't think of anyone! So, when I had the opportunity of a lifetime to see Snoop Dogg (and others) live I was more than thrilled. I was excited as I have ever been in my entire life. I felt like a kid on Christmas morning. Snoop Dogg is a legend in the rap world and he did nothing less than live up to that legacy during this show at Coachella. He kept the audience involved in the show the entire time. There was not one dull moment, it was probably one of the best nights of my life. At one time, I swear he even looked right at me and pointed and winked at me. I almost died! I was so excited. His music is well, Snoop Dogg's music and if you like it you love it. I enjoyed all the old school music that he played as well as some of the newer songs he has. His performance was great. He had me smiling the entire time, I seriously couldn't believe I was seeing Snoop Dogg. Like, it was him, right there in front of me. I will never forget that night. One of the best ever! "
Snoop Dogg,Last night's snoop show was a blast !! We puffed puffed passed  till we couldn't anymore cuz the show ended but The smooth dark chocolate rapper has done it again in Colorado showing us that his vital stamina and  pure heart and soulkeeps him ahead of the pack !! Well since it was spoiled rasta Rosa's 4 th Snoopsy concert in 2016 I'll rate it #2 after the 420 concert with wiz @ Fiddlers Green in April I loved the old school feel with Bone Thigs and harmony it was like my cherry got poped again 18 years later took me right back to the Glorydays !!! Lol I love you Snoop I am your biggest Fan from Colorado. It's funny Snoop was talking about bucket lists last night and go sure smoking with the Dogg face to face blowing o's in each other's face is definitely on my bucket list ! Bring The wifey and Martha we will all get down ! Thank you Snoop for listening to yourself to be who you are you inspire the best of us !!! 
Snoop Dogg,"Well, it was great to see him do so many hits, (and I actually really admired the athleticism of the 2 pole dancers on the stage). However, it really felt like he was phoning it in. The show was 1 long medley. I don't think he performed 1 song from beginning to end, and there was definitely a lack of energy on the stage. But, ya know what? My friend and I agreed; if anyone has earned the right to do that, it's him at this point in his career. Now, if I had paid $150 or $300 I would've been pissed and felt ripped off. But the for the $60 I paid, it was fine. We enjoyed the show, and I always enjoy going to the Concord in Chicago - it's a great venue: best acoustics anywhere, plenty of elbow room even for sold out shows, and plenty of bars with little or no waiting. "
Snoop Dogg,"The overall show was 5.5 hours so it was good value from that perspective.  Kudos to the long line-up.  I've seen Snoop perform about 10 times.  The good thing is that his overall stage presence was fairly long and he touched on many songs, albums and artists and he made a decent effort.  The bad part is that he shortens all the songs by about half, to ensure he can cover more songs (which I think is fine), but also speeds the bpm of songs which makes them a bit disorienting to those that know the songs and lyrics.  I didn't love the dancing girls personally but that is a matter of taste.  Wow, since he stopped wearing Adidas, his wardrobe style ranking has sure dropped a quite a few levels! ; ) "

Snoop Dogg,"Disappointed The quality of the Music was really poor. we were on the third floor we couldn t hear anything. and then we moved on the ground floor... It was little bit better but fuck come on.. the quality is much better during a hockey game... About the artists.... hahaha... i cant say anything about redman et methodman cause we couldnt hear anything... Cypress was good and Snoop is over with his commercial music now. I missed ""the up in smoke tour"" 2001 "
Snoop Dogg,Show was great whole way thur cant wait till next show see you again what day I can remember is I saw you come through with a Letterman's jacket on and then you walk over to the side and you took it off in like a white tent and you came out on stage in the sweat suitthat CUZZ I was like oh my God he's going to be so hot and then I watched the whole way the whole show  and I was like this dude didn't sweat at least one time LOL great show please come again. 
Snoop Dogg,"The concert all the way around was so LIT I have been to many concerts and I would have to say by far the best concert I have ever witnessed in my life. I can�t even say who was better Bone Thugz, Warren G and Snoop where all amazing !!! I am so happy that I was able to witness this concert and the storm going down in the back round just made the concert that much better !! "
Snoop Dogg,"It sucked. Cypress hill was dope... if they promoted that snoop dogg and wiz were collaborating and performing together I would have never gone. It was garbage snoop should just stick to himself on stage and play his style of music. Don't waste your money on going. Unless u like that new style of ""hip hop"" than its perfect but if not than definitely don't waste your money "
Snoop Dogg,"Snoop Dogg's show brought together the community. We had a bit of an unrest issue a few months prior to Snoop coming to town and at that show all I felt was love in the room. There were no fights, to drama. It was all love and respect for one another and for the music. It was such a fun show. So glad I got to see this legend in person. "
Snoop Dogg,"the concert was really awesome I loved seeing all the amazing artists coming together and singing about what there passionate about and what they live for. I loved how they took a moment to make tribute to the legendary artists that have passed away, they truly have a respect for amazing artists. "
Snoop Dogg,the show was great. heard all my favorites from all the artists. Snoop had strippers and cash machines and all.Only thing that could have made the show better was a better venue. The richmond coliseum is not a nice venue and need a new sound system. but snoop and all the artist did the thing. 
Snoop Dogg,What can I say I love me some Snoop Dogg!!! As always he was great. Sound had a problem here and there but Snoop is a pro and took care of buisness. My only complaint is I didn�t get enough and I didn�t get invited to come party with him or DJ Quick after the show! 
Snoop Dogg,It was an amazing time! So much fun! Cheap tickets. Beer was of course wayyy overpriced. I dont like that this review needs 30 words because i really have nothing else to say about the concert. Also i haven't had to count words like this since college. 
Snoop Dogg,"When I heard that Snoop & Wayne were doing a show together, I knew I'd be there. That is legendary. And it was. Incredible night from 2 of the best to ever do it. The vibe was insane. The crowd was lit & happy. Couldn't have asked for a better night! "
Snoop Dogg,Snoop Dogg was awesome to see live! In combination with Wiz Khalifa puts the show over the top! Presentation and production was orchestrated well! Security and food accommodations were ok and there always could be more free stuff lol! 
Snoop Dogg,It was so fucking lit that night everyone smoking weed and no one saying anything I was honestly so much fun! Only shitty thing was how short the concert and how they made me go to the lawn or I had to put my joint out. 
Future,"Fresh off of his sophomore album release this past April, rapper Future announced that he would be headlining the #HonestTour in various cities across the United States, aptly named for his album of the same title, Honest. Of these tour dates, June 10th, 2014 would be hitting Charlotte, NC at Amos� Southend. Not only that, but up and coming rapper Que (known for his street anthem �OG Bobby Johnson�) and crossover sensation Rico Love would be his supporting acts.    For those who might not know who exactly Future is, he�s an Atlanta, GA native who managed to make a name for himself by flooding the streets with projects throughout 2010-2012 that included the Streetz Calling and Astronaut Status mixtapes, which really grabbed the attention of hip-hop followers nationwide. On top of that, Future�s unique sound which encompasses his ability to rap as well as sing (albeit auto-tuned) have given him a leg up on the competition. Once he started to get the attention that he rightly deserved, he capitalized on it by releasing notable singles including �Tony Montana� and �Same Damn Time� which subsequently made it onto his debut album, Pluto. In addition to that, Future became arguably the best �hook� artist in the hip-hop/rap genre and further promoted himself by hopping on YC�s hit song �Racks�, which turned into a hit almost overnight � it now has 18+ million views. Since that point, things for Future have snowballed into mainstream success and now it�s almost impossible to not hear his voice on the radio.    This evening also marked the third time in the past two years that Future has performed in Charlotte. He co-headlined the Power 98 SummerFest in August of 2012 at the Uptown Amphitheatre with Ace Hood, Chief Keef & Travis Porter. More recently, he opened for Drake alongside Miguel on the Toronto rapper�s Would You Like a Tour? at Time Warner Cable Arena.    After the standard milling around and house music prior to anyone performing, things started to kick off at around 8:15-8:30pm with Rico Love. He was on stage for roughly 20-25 minutes and performed, among other songs, �B*tches Be Like�, Usher�s �There Goes My Baby� (which he wrote), and �What You Saying� before capping things off with his most recent hit, �They Don�t Know�, which essentially turned the entire venue into one big sing-a-long session.    The crowd was really starting to get warmed up at this point and undoubtedly would have gotten out of control had Que come on to perform his trunk-rattling hit �OG Bobby Johnson�. Unfortunately, he was MIA and never made an appearance. Therefore, another session of house music began between acts that lasted for roughly 30 minutes or so before the main attraction hit the stage. But my oh my, was it worth it.    The lights dimmed, smoke covered the stage. It was time. TURN UP TIME.    In less than 30 seconds, Future transformed an otherwise mild crowd into a loosely contained riot, which I was at the forefront of.    The first song Future performed was �Chosen One�, off of the FBG: The Movie mixtape. From there, the Atlanta native continued to lay down hit after hit as the audience ascended to Pluto, then Mars, at the same damn time.    All things considered, this night proved to be a success and Future yet again reiterated why he was a force to be reckoned with in the hip-hop industry. If you somehow managed to miss him last night, you�re not entirely out of luck. Future will be performing tonight at the House of Blues in Myrtle Beach if you�re willing to make a drive. It will be well worth your time and he�ll undoubtedly crush the stage, but hey, I�m just being #Honest. "
Future,"I saw Future perform for the first time at the Fillmore in Charlotte, NC last year in March. If always said anytime he comes to Charlotte to perform I WILL BE THERE. My son and I attended the Nobody safe tour on Sunday here in Charlotte and he put on a HELLUVA SHOW, and his DJ, Esco, OMG. He knows how to get a crowd CRUNK. I love them both. I CAN'T EXPRESS IT BUT IF HE WAS TO COME BACK THIS YEAR I WILL GO SEE HIM AGAIN. We really enjoyed the concert. I'm a die hard Future fan and so is my son. I love future and his music. I feel a lot of lyrics. One if my dreams or wishes is to meet Future and do Esco. They are so HElluva, but the two of them together is like launching a bomb. I'm A FUTURE FREEBANDZ FAN 4 LIFE. I LOVE ME SOME FUTURE "
Future,"Security was very poorly executed.I get that in the Mosh Pit there will be a degree of pushing but hair pulling,people elbowing down to the ground,nails ripped off,earrings ripped out is NOT ok just to push me away from the front where I was.I then decided to move to the back and then there were people fighting, countless people smoking weed which made me sick yet security just walked by.In fact at one point one of the Show Sec security (blonde girl) shoved past me nearly knocking me off my feet!I will never ever attend this Venue ever again,absoulutely awful and a traumitising experience to say the least to be honest very horrible experience! "
Future,Yo I had so much fun at this show!!!! And they hooked Future's stage stuff up nice!! With the lights and smoke and the DJ!!! It was also so cool how he had the confetti come down from the ceiling!! Ty Dolla Sign had a nice performance and so did the new music artist from Dreamchaser Records!!! Future himself killed it!!! Hot performance!!! Like I said I really enjoyed myself!! Hot Show and I can't wait till he comes back here to Philly to do another show!!! And i just want to say that the Fillmore is a nice place that was my first time there and I hope that they keep bringing  talented artist there !! Enjoy your day!! God Bless 
Future,"This was the worst show I have been to by far. I go to a lot of concerts and I am pretty sure these good reviews come from hypebeasts who suck dick for artists like future. To back up my claim, Future would change the song while in the middle of rapping another, he would constantly walk off stage for minutes at a time, not even playing his own music while he was off, the audio was off entirely. The most I heard a song play was about a minute and he would change songs before the beat even dropped sometimes. Good thing I got my ticket as a gift otherwise it would have been a complete waste of money. Do not go to these shows. "
Future,It was a damn good concert.  Im glad i went.  First ty $dolla sign came out and did a decent show but it was only 30 minutes. Some songs he only singed past of it. Next future came out and it was a dope show.  It had some and mirrors and great effects to make it better.  He preformed all his old hits first then took a 5 minute break and did his new hits. He preformed alot of songs great show. 
Future,"Seen Future Sat June 3 in Indianapolis,In I'm white male 59yrs old This was my 1st rap concert It was great All the rappers put on a great show High energy! SO glad I went to this show Never thought I'd get to see Future Live! What a great experience I gotta see JuicyJ next if possible Hope Future comes to Indy again soon "
Future,Future was supposed to be Nicki Minaj�s Supporting act for her 11th March 2019 show but he did not appear to be there and there was no email telling me otherwise. I am upset by this as there should of been some recognition of this before or at least during the show. 
Future,"this concert was really good, except the fact that future appeared only for around half an hour. There was no problem at all, maybe just when one of the singer's singing was kind off boring. In general we spent a pretty nice moment there "
Future,Wish I can go to the Future concert in Miami but I'm fighting for my life and Stewart hospital Martin South have infection in my lungs and in my heart keep it real at the concert be nice to be there maybe next time 
Future,"dope af, migos killed it. Ferg didnt rap for too long, was hoping hed sing more. future was really good and tory lanez was whatever, he think he super hype but everyone was just waiting for migos to get on lol "
John Legend,"John Legend will make the strongest guy in the venue shed a tear with his intimate performances. While he does have an incredible voice you will be floored by his even more incredible piano playing. It is a perfect event you can take your significant other to for a romantic date night. The atmosphere in the venue is beautiful and you can even see people at floor level get up with their partners to dance to the songs. In between songs he even tells the audiences little cute stories. His popular song ""All Of Me"" was a crowd favorite, and it's amazing when thousands of people sing in unison. John Legend is grace personified and a very classy man. He literally only needs a piano and a microphone to show people a good time. I do recommend for people with future plans to attend a John Legend show to please bring tissues unless you want to end up like me and use my shirtsleeves to wipe tears. Oh and most importantly if you are planning to propose to your significant other be warned there are possibly ten other couples also getting engaged in the venue. So is it really that original? But don't take my advice I would like to get proposed at a John Legend concert, so do it anyway. "
John Legend,"John Legend certainly lived up to his name. He made me cry with his rendition of Bridge Over Troubled Waters & the story of his grandmother. It felt like a very personal and warm performance with an old friend, telling you about how he got his break. The fact that he rubbed shoulders with Alicia Keys, another piano impresario sealed the deal for me.    In an era where so many performers rely on a massive entourage, 15 strong band plus backing singers,  sexual displays or frankly auto tune, John showed them how to deliver a wonderful show with just his perfect instruments & a few friends.    His beautiful voice, his musicality along with intimate stage lighting, the wonderful strong quartet  (who are stars in their own right) and the best lyrics that take you back to that romance that didn't last, he appealed to every generation.    The only thing I felt was out of place was his rendition of Rock with You (courtesy of MJ) but he sang it well and as I am a massive MJ fan, it was more paying homage than a cover version for me.    If I could play the piano like John can, I would already have fulfilled my life's dream.    Well done I will be back to see you again. "
John Legend,"It has been a decade since the last time I watched John Legend, yet, I remember every moment vividly.    It all started off when I bought his 'Get Lifted' album by random. He wasn't as 'mainstream' as he is today. Nobody I knew had even heard of him let alone any of his songs. I had my mum play the album in the car non-stop. Weeks went by and I knew word for word the entire album � as if I recited bible verses. Watching John Legend perform songs like 'Ordinary People', 'Let's Get Lifted' and 'Refuge' made me � and I am sure half of the audience � believe that the world was at peace. His songs are mellow and relaxing; the way people melted and swayed side to side to song after song in unison. That night it was just him and his piano, and that's all you need with vocal chords such as his. He also performed a new song called 'Slow Dance' from an album he was working on (now known as Once Again). John Legend is a big name now; performing on a global scale with other famous artists like Kanye West, The Roots, Andre 3000 and so on. I've seen him perform elsewhere, but nothing compares to that night, my first ever concert. Legend by name, Legend by nature. "
John Legend,"Well..Seeing John live was amazing not only because I like as a singer but also because he has been part of my days especially this last year.    It is my first John's concert but I can tell that I will go again when he will be back in Italy.  He played most of his last album songs (Love in the future) and also some classics like ""Ordinary people"" and ""Greenlight"", ""Maxine"" etc.    The theatre was full...sold out in Padova. He played the piano for most of the concert, He was wonderful. The band also was amazing, really good vibes. I think he is right now the king of soul and part of R&B. His voice is unique.    It was I think the classic situation of a good concert in theatre, with right now one of the best singers in scene. The really experience of jazz, blues and soul. I was there!!! "
John Legend,"My friend said to me John Legend's style reminded him of Frank Sinatra. Classy, sophisticated and debonair. These are the best words to describe JL. From the time he stepped on stage he had control of the Barclays center... He was very entertaining, interacting with the crowd and giving a lot of background info about himself. I totally forgot that Kanye West was heavily involved in his career and he played piano on so many of my favorite songs from Alicia Keys to Lauren Hill to Slum Village and of course Kanye. My favorite part was when he sang a cover of Michael Jackson''s Rock Wit You....outstanding!!! His music is soothing to the soul. No flashy sets or costume changes...just all JL!!! "
John Legend,"Hey! The concert of John Legend was just INCREDIBLE! It was my first concert and, I found this really good. John Legend is a person so nice. During his concert he told us to never forget to say �I love you� to who we love, he�s the definition of love. His voice is the same that�s in his video, no difference, the members of the chorus, the musicians, HIM, everything was perfect! He had choose a girl of the public to slow dance with her, it was magical. I have no words to describe this concert. Thank you very much to him, he reminds us to love people who encircles us, his words are honest and completely true. Thank you again and again to John Legend and his crew. - Adelina.R "
John Legend,"All in all the concert was amazing. He started off with his more popular known songs that were a bit more upbeat, then moved into his slower songs while playing the piano. He had three girls singing and dancing in the background and it was very cool to see a concert with that type of style in it. There were many songs about love so for anyone in a relationship I highly recommend going with your partner for a nighr out. For anyone debating whether or not to go to the concert, if you are in to a bit slower pace than most concerts or even a concert junky like me this is definitely one you dont want to miss. "
John Legend,"All of Me Tour 2014 at Pacifico Yohohama, Japan was absolutely Amazing! John Legends vocals were pitch perfect and his musicians are impeccable! My favorite part of the show is the trip down memory lane that he took us on and I simply love his sense of humor!! I was so into each and every moment of the concert that when it was over I was still yearning for more but all good things must come to an end. Can't wait for his next album.  Signed,  A Fan Since Day One "
John Legend,"John Legend. All I can say is that it was totally perfect. Me and my girl totally had fun and it was totally magical. And the orchestra we're so good! I couldn't believe that I was witnessing all that in person. Especially because we sat in the first row, right in front of him. It felt so intimate. Paying for those front row tickets were so worth it. Hearing his voice live is just so much better than hearing it on my Ipod. "
John Legend,"A sublime performance! John Legend oozes charisma when on-stage and belting out his top songs, taken from his recent album 'Darkness and Light'. His entire band and the back-up singers also got their own moments to shine! Stand-out moments from the show had to include the lucky lady, who from the front row, was picked out to dance on stage with John Legend. Also his song for his new baby daughter was beautiful. "
John Legend,"The concert was none short of AMAZING!  I absolutely loved it! He went through the chronology of his music career gave us music from the beginning of his career up until now. I thoroughly enjoyed the story setup. He made us laugh, cry smile and dance. His songs sends you through so many emotions and he sounds just like the record. The live band was amazing as well! "
John Legend,"What an amazing loved filled, good energy, sensual, love life, make peace performance Very jealous of Krista getting to move slow with you, but happy for her . Love you as a person, you wife and daughter are lucky to have you in thier lives it seems. God Bless, and I'll continue to love as my last . Alisha "
John Legend,What a PERFORMANCE!!!  John Legend didn�t disappoint!  Matter-of-fact...he BLEW the ROOF OFF the GINGERBREAD HOUSE with his silky vocals and stage presence that matched. John THANK YOU Thank you for bringing the Holiday Cheer to Boston!!!  A Legendary Christmas with John Legend is truly a gift for the Season! 
John Legend,John legend was an amazing performer to go see.. he sang all his popular songs and got so personal that brought someone up the stage to dance with him. His messages of love where so beautiful and he just spread the love with everyone... totally must see in concert type of person. You will love him! 
John Legend,"Omg!!!!! John Legend was incredible!!! Best concert I�ve ever been to and one of my favorite artists. He was very entertaining and was communicating with us the audience! I also loved the fact that he included songs from his previous albums. A concert I�ll never forget, had so much fun!!! <3 "
John Legend,"Jack Savoretti was incredible -  beautiful and soulful voice with modest staging and great crowd engagement. John Legend performed well vocally and his stage design was great, but his stamina wasn't very good and his performance felt impersonal and as though he was going through the motions. "
John Legend,"John Legend has such a beautiful voice, his show was wonderful. He had some great anecdotes between some of the songs and we really enjoyed the concert. I was so so bummed when it was over because I could have listened to him for so much longer. Abolustely loved it! "
John Legend,"Man this John Legend concert was super amazing. I actually went by myself and I think it would've been even better with someone special beside me. But like I said my man, I had a great time by myself. Awesome show and everyone should go to a John Legend show. "
John Legend,"It was amazing! One of the best concerts I've ever been to... amazing voice, great show, band and backup singers... An auto-buy artist, for sure! It had some funny moments, a proposal in the middle of the audience and a lot of good music :) "
John Legend,John Legend Was AMAZING ! Sound Was Great Its As If You Were Listening On Pandora Or The Radio ! At The End As Everyone Began Walking Out He Came Back And Preformed All Of Me & Glory ! Sooo Amazing CNt Wait Till He's Back In Florida ! 
Fleetwood Mac,"Monday 22nd June. The O2. Fleetwood Mac. A bit of trepidation tonight. Have we got decent seats in the vast dome that is the O2, are the Mac on song, swallowed their many and varied differences and will we get back to Waterloo for the last train. Not to spoil the tension but it�s a yes, yes and thrice yes. Me and my wife, sounds weird to say that again, venture off down the Jubilee line with all the other middle aged ex rockers to see the hottest ticket in town. We rub shoulders with Heidi from the Sugababes, ahhh pause for a quiet moment to myself, and then it�s ready for the show. The Walker ticket machine works its magic and though we are at the back on the floor we are on the second row of a raised platform so we can see across those who paid significantly more than us for pretty much the same view. I won�t rehearse the tempestuous story of the Mac as its too long and too complicated but suffice to say they have all being either married, engaged or romantically involved with each other for the past forty years. Christine McVie has re-joined the band after a 16 year absence and the circle is once again complete. It all somehow works and that tension has led to some of the greatest pop songs ever written in those decades. Set opener �The Chain� starts the show as it means to go on. The rhythm section of Mick and John are solid and relentless and don�t let up throughout the show and provide a flawless platform for the front three to build on. There�s clearly some deal between the Christine, Stevie Nicks and Lyndsey Buckingham that they all have an equal quota of their own songs to get through and in the main that works albeit the latter two can slightly cross the line into self-indulgence. The set hasn�t changed over the ninety odd shows in this tour and draws heavily from Fleetwood Mac and Rumours. All the hits are there, the vocals are spot on especially Christine�s who I think I have been guilty of under estimating in the past. The same is true of Lyndsey Buckingham�s guitar playing; often understated he can rock out with the very best with a unique open strumming style that I�ve not seen before. The highlight for me is the three song acoustic segment which starts with just Lyndsey singing an emotional �Big Love� (slightly spoilt by some existential monologue preamble) and then joined by Stevie for a spine tingling �Landslide� which brought the lump to throat, hairs on end and tears in eye moment. Sublime. It�s a slick two and a half hour show and forty years later they still have it. Unnecessary Mick Fleetwood drum solo and a low key although perfectly delivered final encore of �Songbird� aside it was the perfect show. A swift exit and we�re home by midnight. "
Fleetwood Mac,"Hello, It was a great night filled to the rafters! I feel as much as I did enjoy it, there was a couple of things that need to be aired, I am sure I was not the only one. No offence intended here so please note this. I came to see Fleetwood Mac, Yes I do like Neil Finn�s music and it was a thrill to see and hear him playing, I am also aware that nowadays, it�s the thing with bands that they have members from other top bands play with them as members of the group or share the time and advertise that they are both playing on stage basically sharing so they have the invited one open for them, yes that is feat. But this was not the case. Neil Finn was playing and singing with them, Neil also payed and sung at least three of his top hits even that I did not mind! But what I did mind was we were all sitting there for 20 mins or more waiting for them to come out and start, The tickets said( Show starts 8:00pm SHARP! ) so we could have been listening to Neil Finn play his 3 songs and more for the 20 mins. That�s not all! Stevie Nicks I am well aware this group may be aging and probably can�t cope with singing and playing for two hours straight like they used to but why wasn�t Stevie singing all her own songs or only actually singing some of the song while the blonde one was singing most of it for her, am I missing something here? I understand if there was a reason for this but the other one doesn�t even sound anything like Stevie, this was disappointing. Couldn�t believe even after they came on 20 mins late they only sang one song for encore never even gave us our 20minutes back! Bit mean really considering those who spent $a considerable amount of money to go and hear their band play. We all sat there only one or two songs did we all join in with and after all that they didn�t even play �TUSK� I thought they would have at least finished with this one, nup waited all night to hear it, so feel a tad let down to put it politely! I hope they take this on board and do something about it for Melbourne! I doubt they will be back as that�s why I put myself out to go this time. If they did I wouldn�t bother again to be honest had great seats here too! "
Fleetwood Mac,"I am a huge fan of Fleetwood Mac, regardless of the exact lineup, as long as the core is there, and for me, the core is the rhythm section, bass and drums.  John and Mick are like a machine and are definitely in the Top Ten Rhythm Sections in rock, past and future. I have liked them with Peter Green and Jeff Spencer, with Christine, and with Stevie and Lindsey.   The thing that has tied all of these iterations together has really been Mick Fleetwood.  He is a machine, I think of him sort of as a steam locomotive. Because he is so tall, when he starts up, sometimes there is an inperceptable lag, and he plays his snare primarily behind the beat, laid back big time, but once he is rolling, that size imparts inertia (1st Law of Motion, 2nd half) and smoothness in his playing, grooving on the top with perfect timing.  Also some drummers just drum, boom pop boom pop, standard rock and blues beats, but Fleetwood plays parts. Few do this, and they are usually considered to be among the greats, Watts, Starr, Helm, Pocaro, Collins, think about it. Then there is one other thing great drummers do(and musicians in general), AND THIS IS THE HARDEST, THEY KNOW WHEN NOT TO PLAY, including playing fewer fills. All that I have said is not meant to discount the fact that FM was lucky enough to bring together several of the greatest voices in music history.  Also they were all very unique, character voices, unique, which is what I love in a voice, but it means that that singer may be VERY hard to replace.  If they weren't, they would not be unique. I have written too much, but my last point is, if a band needs to replace a ""unique singer"", most times, I think they should let the new singer be themselves, otherwise it probably won't work, if they are lucky and may even sound corny, fake, bad.   FM has made this mistake a couple of times in later years, but they are still on 90% of the time, and at their level, that is something. "
Fleetwood Mac,"Fleetwood Mac were a little before my time. Having formed in 1967 as a British blues band, Mick Fleetwood had already seen the complete transformation of personal and sound by the time I was born. In fact, up until recently, I thought the Buckingham-Nicks line-up represented the original Fleetwood Mac. As it turns out, Rumours was actually their eleventh album�and it beat me into this world by exactly four days. That was an amazing time for Fleetwood Mac as a band, but it was also a tumultuous time for its members. There are almost as many stories and documentaries about the drug-fueled, incestuous nature of the band as there are songs by the band, so I won�t delve too deep into those right now, but I will say that Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks, Christine McVie, John McVie and Mick Fleetwood are shining examples of �what doesn�t kill you makes you stronger�. - See more at: http://ilistensoyoudonthaveto.com/2015/04/03/fleetwood-mac-pepsi-center-04-01-15/#sthash.tZUzkIAN.dpuf "
Fleetwood Mac,"I didn't realize how much we were missing until Christine opened her mouth. With the first note of her voice it hit me instantly that she is the soulful heart of the band's sound. Having seen the show on their last tour and seven more going back to 1971 the band is like a fist of five when all together. To me being a seasoned Fleetwood Mac fan, I rightfully acknowledge Mic and John as the leaders accompanied by gifted talent. The Lindsey and Stevie duo was added chemistry similar to John and Christine which made for Mic to be the beat of a chemist. They still turn on the enthusiasm of us older folks as well as introduce themselves to the young just as they did in the beginning. No doubt they have built themselves into one of the top artists to entertain the world with their work, pleasing many and fulfilling their heavenly expectations and purpose they were united for. Thanks FM. "
Fleetwood Mac,"One of the best concerts that I've ever attended; and I've been to many a concert over the years.I couldn't see an empty seat in the house and that's almost 20,000 fans who sang along with the band. Stevie Nicks was truly outstanding as were ALL the band members. Words cannot describe the quality of this band and the excitement among fans. Fleetwood Mac's show lasted ninety minutes and that was ninety minutes of pure adrenaline and electricity. A tribute to Tommy Petty with the bands cover of, 'FREE FALLING' was both appropriate and had 20,000 singing along. 'Go YOUR OWN WAY,'brought down the house, along with any number of songs from their catalog. Never mind the absence of Lindsey Buckingham,it made little if any difference at all. This performance was worth every penny and then some. One will NOT want to miss this joy of a concert! "
Fleetwood Mac,"Someone on facebook asked me ""they sound good? or like old rockers?""... This is my response and review here - ""They sounded great ...Stevie may avoid a couple of the top notes here and there, but they have girls backing her up. She's still the same amazing, mystical creature she's always been. Lindsey's guitar playing is better than ever and a total spectacle (and he knows it.. lol ). Christine's return brings the band's distinctive harmonies back, not to mention 6 songs which I can't imagine them doing without her. They're so happy all be together through it all that the mutual respect is palpable as they've all put their dramas behind them for the greater good. They brought the house down with ""Go Your Own Way"" before the first encore. .. What an arsenal of songs they throw at you.. just an amazing show!"" "
Fleetwood Mac,"To tell the truth, before the evening started I was more excited at the prospect of seeing Chryssie Hynde and The Pretenders again (they didn�t disappoint, and she continues to inspire - I was mystified as to why more folk didn�t turn up sooner - this was a support act truly worth catching). On reflection, as good as they were, the main event was to follow. And how. From the opening chords of The Chain, the greatest songs (with the exception of Sara - how come?) were crafted, as fresh as if it was 30, 40, 50 (any advance?) years ago. A treat to see Neil Finn join the band, and delirium almost set in when he duetted Don�t Dream It�s Over with Stevie Nicks. She kidded us - how to follow such a song, she teased - then gave a perfect version of Landslide. Delirious, delicious, delighted. "
Fleetwood Mac,"In 1977 when I was 18 years old, one of my singing idols was Stevie Nicks and the band Fleetwood Mac.  Singing was and is a passion of mine.  I joined a rock n' roll band and sang for many years.  My husband was the lead guitarist in the band.  Our band did not get a break even though we worked hard, starved, and struggled through our passions.  My husband and I went to the Fleetwood Mac Concert at the Rogers Arena in Vancouver, BC, on Saturday April 4th, 2015.  It was the original band including Christine McVie. The show was fantastic.  We were not disappointed.  They sang and played exactly how I imagined they would when I was 18 years old.  We had a blast.  We will never forget that night and were thrilled to have seen, in our opinion, one of the best bands there is. "
Fleetwood Mac,"Overall, a terrific show.  Christine McVie was in great form showing that she still has the best voice in the band.  Mick Fleetwood was a ball of energy and fun to watch.  Stevie Nicks' voice is not quite what it used to be (to be honest, I never thought much of her voice anyway), and she avoided the high notes all night. John McVie was steady and solid on the bass, but the mix was muddy and rumbly, so you couldn't really pick up the nuances of his playing.  The stars of the night were the Lindsey Buckingham substitutes (interesting that it took two guys of incredible talent in their own rights to replace Lindsey) - Neil Finn and Mike Campbell.  It's worth seeing the Mac just for these guys alone!  Good show to catch if you can! "
Fleetwood Mac,"I saw Fleetwood Mac last night in Auburn Hills.   The show was better than I expected.  They played for close to 2 & 1/2 hours.  I originally had some concern as to how their voices would be after all these years, but they sounded great.  Lindsey  was so full of energy and played his heart out.  A great drum solo towards the end by Mick Fleetwood.  Fun to see Chritine McVie back on stage.  Stevie Nicks dedicated a song to Kid Rock and sure enough, as it finished, he walked out on stage to give her a hug.  The had an amazing video screen as a back drop which really helped for close up shots.  The sound could have been a bit better in a smaller venue (The Palace at Auburn Hills), but I can't complain.  Great show overall. "
Fleetwood Mac,"Some of my favorite highlights were The Chain (great opener, fantastic harmonies), the acoustic portion consisting of Big Love, Landslide, and Never Going Back Again (Lindsay tour it up on guitar), Over My Head and Little Lies were the 2 stand out Christine McVie songs, Tusk and World Turning (with a fun drum solo) were my favorite Mick Fleetwood numbers and my fav Nick's songs were Gold Dust Woman and Silver Springs BRILLIANT!!!! All the big hits were great too - Dreams, You Make Loving Fun, Go Your Own Way. The songs I would've liked to have heard were I Don't Wanna Know, Seven Wonders (which they were playing earlier this tour) and Songbird (another song dropped because of Christine's thumb injury). "
Fleetwood Mac,"After 40+ years, multiple generations have grown up listening to Fleetwood Mac. Everyone has a memory to one of their songs. Fleetwood Mac live is a magical musical experience woven with glimpses of genuine emotion and raw truth between all members, but especially Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham. Stevie serves a masterclass in emotional survival through a voice that has grit, power, and wisdom. Lindsey comes out of the gate with an energy and feverish guitar technique that could melt one's face off. They all truly love that they're still able to do this, and their gratitude shows. Don't miss it. "
Fleetwood Mac,It was so good words just can't describe the energy on stage as well as the audience. The show was up there with the Very Very best. Mick Fleetwood was the best at getting the crowd into it. The group was amazing with the new look supporting cast. If they continue to tour and come back to South Florida it's a know Brain er. We will go see them again. It's a must to see them perform again. Stevie and Christine what can I say. They are the best. One from each side of the pond. You can't get better than that. The new boys on the block did not miss a beat. Was just in awe all night. Bruce Shore 
Fleetwood Mac,"Great seats and views of the stage. The vibe was buzzing long before the group appeared on stage in this very large,fan-filled venue. Loved the lighting,LED and visual effects. The sound system enhanced Fleetwood's unique brand of music. I could not think of any of their songs that they did not sing. Mick celebrated his birthday in style with an impressive drum solo while Christine,John,Lindsey and Stevie pumped out their repertoire in their own inimitable style. It was worth travelling over 10,000kms to be a part of the London experience. Make an effort to be a part of musical history. "
Fleetwood Mac,The band was energetic and seemed to enjoy their own vibe. Christie adds a tremendous amount of versatility with a 3rd lead singer. I was a little disappointed in the rhythm section. McVie and Fleetwood did not have a good night. They did not seem tight with Mick dragging many songs. Acoustics at the Amelie arena are typical for that type of venue. We was located behind the sound board. We would have had the best mix in the house. It was only passable. All in all it was a great time seeing a band who has stood the test of time and still together in the format that was most popular. 
Fleetwood Mac,"After around 48 years these guys still put on a great show, with real enthusiasm.  With Christine McVie back in the band, the ""classic"" line-up from the '70s is complete again, and they all seem to be thriving on it.  They filled a 2h20 set with their best-known songs from the 70s and 80s - don't expect anything from the Peter Green-era blues stuff.  Surprising not to have any support act, I can't recall any other gig I've been to where there has been no support.  Tickets sold fast for this show, but they justified the enthusiasm that their fans still have for them. "
Fleetwood Mac,"Couldn't WAIT to see them again and they Didn't disappoint...Mick Fleetwood's Drum Solo will live long in the Memory & Will Surely be ONE of those I was THERE moments. Original members are all pretty much Septengenarians but the Audience were enthralled, Neil Finn and Mike Campbell were great adds to this Supergroup. The Weather held up (always take the weather with YOU Neil) & 'DON'T Dream IT'S OVER'was a nice touch... certainly we were in Dreamland after the gig SADLY going our own way While the band went Theirs Catch em well you can Brill!!!!! "
Fleetwood Mac,"Was anxious about observing the band less Lindsey Buckingham. Every one of the anxieties went out of the entryway when the show began. From the opening note to the last ting of the cymbals Fleetwood Mac put on a breathtaking show. Every one of the individuals got their opportunity to excel and the tremendous video board behind the band took into consideration each seat to be an incredible seat. Furthermore, we were altogether amazed by the immense scope of hits that this group has made. Take a brief trip and see them live, no second thoughts! "
Britney Spears,"Britney Spears is a true performer; every aspect of her show is designed to entertain and delight her audience. She always has a varied set list that includes old favorites like 'Baby One More Time' and 'Oops' as well as new classics like 'Womanizer' and 'Perfume'. The set(s) at a Britney Spears show are always over the top, and you can expect a lot of surprises. A single performance may include: rain, fire, smoke, moving set pieces and confetti. For her Circus Tour (circa 2007), the audience was transported to a three-ring circus in every way! I loved the stunts and trapeze tricks! Her Dream Within a Dream Tour (circa 2002) had eleborate set pieces and props, including a car! The short-lived Onyx Hotel Tour was raunchy and sassy, much like the 22-year-old Britney at the time. It was cut short due to knee surgery. Britney's Femme Fatale Tour (circa 2011) was action-packed, and ended with her literally flying across a screen of sparks wearing giant wings! Her Piece of Me Tour (Vegas, 2013- ) is absolutely spectacular, with incredible sets, video, audio and TONS of surprises. It goes through five DIFFERENT phases, and ends in an epic dance number! Britney Spears loves to perform and entertain. Every show also includes incredible dancers and absolutely stunning costumes. She often changes five or more times over the course of two hours ... each costume getting more and more elaborate as the show goes on. She will sparkle, enchant, and seduce the audience, depending o the song. Imagining what the costumes will be like is one of the fun parts of seeing her live - she always delivers and delights. Finally, the Britney Army is the BEST group of fans a super star could ask for, and being surrounded by them at a live performance is awesome. We are kind, enthusiastic, and will dance the night away while singing along to our favorite Britney tune. Don't be afraid to say hello - we love meeting fellow Britney fans! "
Britney Spears,"Britney Spears was and continues to be one of the biggest names in music of all time. She is the original pop princess, and watching her live is a once on a lifetime experience that is certainly not to be missed. Britney has a whole array of classics, the best of which are always performed at her shows. There isn�t a single person today who hasn�t heard of �Hit Me Baby One More Time�, surely? Although Britney is not exactly known for her vocal skills, this barely matters when going to see her live. Her shows are a spectacular performance, with bright flashing lights and backing dancers galore. The costume changes are intense, with some outrageous outfits. And the set is incredible. For her Circus Tour, the entire stage was decorated like a circus with Britney as the ringleader: it was visually spectacular to behold. Classic hits such as �Toxic�, �Oops I Did it Again�, �Everytime�, �Circus�, �Womanizer�, �I�m a Slave 4 U� and, of course �Hit Me Baby One More Time�, were all performed and all received an incredible crowd reaction. "
Britney Spears,"What can you really say about an icon like Britney Spears. The princess of pop has an imaginable amount of hits so her setlist could fill a show that lasted all night, yet she selects what she believes is her finest work and what will please her ever-loyal fan base the most. It is worth noting that Britney has not sung completely live in many years, this is just given fact so when you move past this and appreciate the experience that she gives to an audience, it becomes secondary. The video interludes, the impressive dance routines, the light displays and the dazzling costumes all turn a Britney show from a simple gig into an experience. Then add into the equation mega-hits such as 'Gimme More', 'Piece of Me' and '...Baby One More Time' and you have a show that others will struggle to top. Especially when it comes down the all out performance that is the finale of 'I Wanna Go' and 'Womanizer', the audience scream and sing in equal measure as this well trained pop star owns the stage in a way that only Britney can. A delight to watch and a master at work. "
Britney Spears,"I love Britney Spears, so this may be a biased review, but I loved the show! From her first song, Work Bitch, to her last song, Till The World Ends, it was a great show. She changes outfits and scenes every couple songs, continuing to keep my attention for the whole show, even using a ring of fire for her performance of Circus. A couple of her most famous outfits we're on display in the entrance to the Axis theatre, which was fun. I enjoyed hearing all of her songs and energy was great. Would definitely recommend if you are looking for a great show in Las Vegas. "
Britney Spears,"Goddess!!! What an incredible performer, she's still got it. I would forever see Britney live. I don't care if she has live vocals or not. She can dance her ass off and she looks amazing doing it! I am without words for the concert I went to last night. "
Britney Spears,I just went to go see Britney over the weekend. She was absolutely amazing! Definitely in my top 5 performers. She put on a very entertaining show and even performed with a surprise guest...Tinashe. Would totally recommend go seeing her! 
Britney Spears,"Britney is lip-sync queen. This girl can�t sing and dance. I don�t know why she is famous. But I am grateful, because I have seen it, and I think, who didn�t seen it, don�t believe it. It�s like watching DVD. "

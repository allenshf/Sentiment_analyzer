"Rihanna made her entrance through one of the tunnels like a boxer coming out for the main event. Concealing her face under a heavy hood, she slowly found her way onto the platform opposite the stage. A spotlight followed her every move, making the white robe glow, while phone lights provided stars to pierce through the dark night surrounding her. A single microphone waited on a stand as thunderous applause and ear-piercing screams filled the venue, and it served to silence the crowd in an instant. “All along it was a fever, a cold sweat hot-headed believer…” Having exposed nothing more than her unmistakable voice (and fingernails and unmistakable ass) to her audience, there was no doubt as to who was hiding under that robe. The entirety of “Stay” was performed from that position, before she revealed her face. Having attended close to a thousand concerts, it’s not often I find myself in awe at being in close proximity to a musician, but seeing Rihanna standing in front of me, in the flesh, made me realize what a cult of personality she has built around herself. As she continued the performance with “Love the Way You Lie (Part II)”, she was part pop diva, part rock star, part sex symbol, all while never being anything but Rihanna. She is still so young, yet has already solidified herself among the very few people in history who everyone will know by a single name. It was very in the show, but I was already convinced she had earned that status as well. Her voice is her defining talent, but her business acumen, stage presence, attitude, and beauty are what complete the package. - See more at: http://ilistensoyoudonthaveto.com/2016/05/10/rihanna-viejas-arena-05-09-16/#sthash.AluW51yF.dpuf"
"Es hieß der Einlass wäre um 17 Uhr,allerdings waren wir ungefähr um 19 Uhr erst im Stadion und die Musik spielte schon. Draußen wurden dann schon alle nervös."
"With all that has happened in France recently, Rihanna faced a stiff challenge getting Parisians and herself in a summery party mood at the Stadt De France."
"You've seen her music videos. You follow her on twitter. You follow her style, trends, favorites. You sing the lyrics in the shower, driving home with your friends, serenading a lover. But nothing is as real as seeing Rihanna perform live!!!  The energy from the audience, the attitude and power that's thrown back off the stage...ah-maz-ing.   The peeks and valleys from the soulful serenade of Stay to the sexy shock of S&M it's all new once you hear it live!  One of my favorite things about going to a show is not only the excitement building up to it, buying the tickets then getting my bracelet and going in. That's just the beginning. I love more than anything, after seeing a great show and I'm back at home listening to the music, remembering where I was, who I was with, how I felt, what I saw and how much fun we were having when we were rocking out and suddenly, Rihanna isn't just some celebrity entertainer, she is a part of something bigger and the music is suddenly different, better, more meaningful.   I've seen Rihanna a couple of times and every time that girl delivers. Her fans love her, she has attitude and swag that makes her real and sometimes the energy leaves you glowing for days and asking yourself, how long do I have to wait until music makes me feel this high again?"
"It was a great concert from the begining. DJ Mustard started the show, and it was wery good warm up, people were dancing."
"Rihanna's Anti World tour concert in Malmö was even better than I expected. I have to be honest, I was not a big fan of hers but of course Queen Riri changed that with her beautiful yet slaying personality and amazing voice. The overall experience was fun althought the only thing that was a littlee annoying is the fact that the concert started a little more than an hour later than what it was supposed to. But I mean.. it's Rihanna, she can do whatever. A tips from me would be to either buy the standing tickets as close to the scene as possible or buy the ones that are high up and on the opposite side of the scene. I was up and although it was long away from Riri it was magical to see all the people and the lights and literary everything. If you're hesirating weather you should go or not I would tell you to go go go, because it is such a beautiful and fun experience to have!"
In one word - unforgettable.
"Rihanna is probably one of the best pop artists at the moment. I've gone to three shows - first in Portugal, in her ""Loud"" tour; 2nd in London in a small venue for her ""777"" tour; and the last one in Richmond park, as part of the ""Unapolagetic"" tour.    All of them were incredibly amazing! Her songs put so much energy in the crowd and it's impossible to not get stuck to her dance moves and stage special effects."
"Daaaammmn. I didn't know what to expect, especially since I found myself more excited for the preshow of 'the weeknd'to the Rhianna tour and contemplated selling the tickets after he and Travis Scott pulled out. I'm glad I didn't. The show itself made me realise just how many anthems Rhianna has to her name.These sprinkled throwbacks were the most memorable for me throughout the show. The set and lighting combined to give a fab production value over all, in particular the very beginning where Rihanna emerged from behind and took a smaller stage before flying off on a clear platform across to the main stage. Overall I really really enjoyed the show. Wasn't quite one that made me jump and wave my arms around, but one that made me appreciate the talent Rihanna clearly has."
"Grate show! Would definitely go see Rihanna live again! Enjoyed everything - signing, visuals, dancing, costumes! Really recommend to watch Rihanna live performance at least once!"
"An amazing experience as one would expect but even though I'm a huge Rihanna's fan you could tell that she became too ""big"" so I didn't feel that connection with the fans even though she was waving to everyone but it didn't feel genuine. At one direction concert for example I felt more interaction from one of the members Liam even though my sister is a bigger fan then I am. I feel like I was born too late lol she's a goddess but the concerts are not like they were in the 80's  or 90's. Overall she proved to me talented and more beautiful than on TV but I will remember her and not the concert so much."
"Incredibly powerful show, red hot, amazing dancers and acrobats, spectacular costumes, fantastic sound and light but most of all flawless vocals by Rihanna and her backing singers, loved the song choices and have been hooked on the Anti album ever since!! Finally the show was a visual sensation, what the whole theme seemingly inspired by dessert troopers / safari chic explorers / inter galactic space oddity head pieces and hoods plus a whole load of shimmer and sequins!"
It was a great fucking show I loved it so much. She is my second favorite female singer second only to Lana Del Rey. Her energy and presence and love for buffalo was present and everyone in the crowd felt it. The only negatives I can think of is that she only sung tidbits of a few songs which made the concert much shorter than necessary also there were remixes on her classics when she should have just stuck with the original beat. 4.5/5 for me.
"Too short, I think people pay a lot of money just for see her and she was late, 20:50 (supposly 20:30) she left at 22:20 (ten minutes before the hour) she spend too much time in the backstage changing her clothes and she didn't finish any song, just Diamond. So I had fun, I sang a lot but is definitely not what we were expecting, bit dissapointed."
"Now, I'm not a massive Rihanna fan, but I went because it was my friends birthday. She was lip syncing most of it, and half the time she was changing cloths, allowing her backing singers to fill in  the rest of it. I would expect someone of her popularity to give her fans, her legit voice. I can only really see Diamonds as the one time she sang properly, so that was a genuine stand out."
"Amazing. So many throwbacks. I really liked the Anti album, but I was also glad that she performed her line in songs like ""Take Care"" ""Run This Town"" ""Love the Way You Lie"", & she did throwbacks like ""Man Down"", ""Umbrella"", and even songs that weren't on her album like ""FourFive Seconds"". Performance is amazing, and her stage presence was ethereal. 10/10 would recommend."
"Love Rihanna and it was great seeing her, however, the Anti World Tour is really mellow/moody and not so much exciting/mind-blowing. The show seemed really fast and it probably didn't help my experience that the girl next to me was hammered and falling into me every minute. Overall, it could've been watched on youtube for a better experience."
Hands down one of the best concerts I've been to in a very long time. She interacted with her fans. She entered from the back so all her fans that were far from the stage got to see her up close. She even brought out surprise guest Drake and he did a couple songs. Truly amazing night. Great show I would definitely see Rihanna again
"Oh na na, that's her name!   I have been to see Rihanna live many times and each time I have been pleasantly suprised. She compeltely owns the stage and puts on an amazing show!  She spends time with the crowd, interacting and does a well rehearsed show of all her greatest hits. Highly recommended!"
"Hello Beautiful Queen Rihanna, when are coming back to Detroit, Michigan for a concert and turn it out? You are a great performer and a fabulous singer. I love your style. Can't wait to see you. Love all of your music. Continue your Legacy. Hope to  see you soon my Queen."
"I had always heard Coldplay were a fantastic band to see live. They did not disappoint last night at Fedex Field, right in the midst of their joyous and decidedly over-the-top Head Full of Dreams tour."
"If you're wondering what to expect from Coldplay, expect the best show of your life!  This was my first time seeing Coldplay at the Royal Albert Hall in London and I have to say this was one of best nights of my life. No exaggeration. They performed many of their most popular classics such as ""Fix you"" and ""The Scientist"" and pretty much all of my favourites ""Charlie Brown"" and ""Every Teardrop is a Waterfall"" including new tracks from their latest album, Ghost Stories.   The atmosphere was incredible; I've never experienced anything like it in comparison. You just had to be there! Coldplay had you dancing out of your seats for their upbeat tracks such as ""Sky Full Of Stars"" and hearing their more mellow tracks like ""True Love"" was just simply beautiful and enchanting. Their playlist for the night was definitely on point and well connected with the crowd and us fans. The stage was right in the center so I'm pretty sure everyone had a great view, it was all set up very well and the lighting looked brilliant.  And as for my most memorable experience? The whole gig! There was a point at the end of ""God Put a Smile Upon Your Face"" when Chris Martin literally threw his electric guitar in the air and let it smash the floor for an epic finish, everyone went crazy!!! Coldplay has been a strong British iconic band for many years now, they know how to put on a show and they honestly do give it their all.   Me and my friend are proud to say that we was there that night, last thing I have to say is that if you ever get the chance to see Coldplay live, grab your tickets and grab them quick!   I promise you, you won't be disappointed in the slightest.  Prepare to be blown away!"
"This was my second time seeing Coldplay, and both times were amazing. The song choice was great, with a mix of classic hits (""Yellow"", ""The Scientist"", ""Viva la Vida"", ""Paradise""( old favourites (""Til Kingdom Come"", and ""Shiver"" being played upon request), and newer, more high energy songs off ""A Head Full of Dreams""."
"There is little in this world that compares to a Coldplay concert. Exhilarating, energetic and euphoric are just some of the words that can be used to describe what one experiences when Chris Martin and band take to the stage."
"First of all I need to just say wow! Wow! Yesterday I experienced one of the greatest nights of my life. Yesterday I really did feel like I was part of something special, something so big and beautiful. The love, the happiness and the excaitment people were feeling last night were something you can't put words on.  We stood in the rain for so many hours, we sat in a que and then we stood in the rain again.. but let me just say that when Coldplay came on stage they put on the best god damn show ever. You could really feel their thankfulness during the show. They promised us (in Chris Martins own words) ""The best fucking show ever"" and let me tell you it was! During the night I got to experience people from different countries dancing and singing along together, I got to experience that moment when Chris decided to write a new song about Sweden and Gothenburg! The night was amazing in so many ways. And just as he said during the night, that he believes when people are working together and last night everybody in that arena stood together. We celebrated the music, the evening and most of all we celebrated the love. Because in the end of the day Love is what matters and it will always win."
"Since the release of Coldplay's fifth album 'Mylo Xyloto' the emphasis of their live show appears to be on the theatrics and the avant-garde. An album so super charged with power pop it was considered a substitute to red bull, the band quickly substituted the tender subtleties of 'Shivers' for the brass tones of 'Charlie Brown' and 'Hurts Like Heaven'. These new tracks are undoubtedly anthemic yet the visual displays and complexing stage layouts slightly detract from the musicianship of the quartet. Whilst performing the more downtempo and emotive tracks from break up album 'Ghost Stories' Chris Martin's vocal sounds notably weak during 'Magic' and all of the pyro-techniques and visuals cannot hide this."
"A Coldplay concert is a real face to face experience for a someone who love their songs. It may not be an intimate experience but considering the legions of fans that they have only a concert can accommodate everyone who are waiting all their lives for a chance to hear them live. and they never disappoint. A total performance complete with lasers and light and firework BUT without much fanfare, just them singing & playing their hearts OUT song after song alone or in harmony with the fans some crying, most gleefully dancing to their upbeat song or swaying OR slow dancing to slow Fix You or Yellow and probably thinking of someone they ""cannot replace"". Chris Martin is an awesome guy and so are the rest of the band. May their personal lives be as awesome as their professional lives, they deserve that too. as to Singapore, it may not be as engaging as it would be in the Philippines but hey, no one can complain; i had the best time celebrating my birthday in one of the best stadium this side of town with around 50K Coldpay fans celebrating with me :) :). Long live Coldplay, may you continue to bring joy to you fans worldwide. Looking forward to another Coldplay concert experience in the future."
"Most AMAZING show I've EVER seen. I've seen some legends. The Who, BB King, Depeche Mode five times, the Cute, Social Distortion, Blue October, many, many more. Coldplay blew them ALL away by far, and I even had crappy seats. I see them again in Philly in August, and I'm counting down the days! Fireworks! The bracelets lit up and changed colors with the stage lighting. Michael J Fox made a special guest appearance playing ""Earth Angel"" and ""Johnny B Good"" with the band. He was spectacular!! The show lasted just over two hours, but it felt like it had just started. Chris Martin may very well be the greatest front man of all time. He can work a crowd, even the stuffed shirts, like nobody's business. Coldplay is my favorite band for a reason, only a few of them listed above. They're all classically trained musicians. All of them multi-instrumentalists. Songs range from ballads to get up on your feet and jump around beats! AMAZING show, AMAZING band! I love you Guy, Jonny, Will, and Chris. Please keep doing what you're doing."
"Piece of para paraa paradise in Berlin!!! It was one of the best shows in my life (if it comes to visual effects), all of these confetti, colourful  powders in the air, and big baloons! One big WOW.  Chris and his band were so joyful, funny and relaxed. I always thought he has a nice voice, nothing spectacular, just ""quite normal voice"". That's my opinion. And after the show I'm not going to change that. Instruments were great, his voice was cool, that's it. But songs were just awesome, I loved that! Especially the older ones like Paradise, The Scientist, Princess of China (ft. Rihanna, I was sooo happy to hear that song!), Fix you, etc. Of course there were many occasions to dance when you heard Hymn for The Weekend (AMAZING, with additional techno(?)dance remixes), Adventure of a lifetime, viva la vida or sky full of stars. My rate from 1 to 5 is 4+. Great atmosphere, great people, I had fun and I definitely want to see Coldplay again! :)"
"Coldplay. What can I say? They are masters of the stadium experience. The fireworks and the LED wrist bands that lit up the stadium and made you feel part of the show, not just watching it.The lightshow, the lasers, the ambiance."
"This was indeed, one of the best concerts I've ever been to."
Great show with Coldplay
Absolutely extraordinary and amazing show! This why is my nine-year-old son's first concert and he left saying that it was one of the best days of his life!
"Excellent show, acoustics and energy. It's Coldplay, so you expect good music. Even then it is awesome that thousands of Germans know every song and sing along."
Colplay Brisbane 6th December 2016@ Suncorp Stadium
"WOW! Amazing! Felt so privileged to be there. I have seen Coldplay many times. This was by far one of the best gigs we have been to given the size of the venue and our close proximity to the band. It felt so intimate and the band were clearly on a high from winning their award.  As always, they were so grateful for the support of their fans and gave a great performance. Euphoria ensued as the band belted out some of their best tracks. Just brilliant! I would happily go back in time and watch it over, and over, and over again! Can't wait to see them next week at the WarChild gig at the O2, then again in June at Wembley and Glasto...thank you Coldplay for being awesome!"
"Dear Songkick, Coldplay's concert was a blast, thank you for asking! :) You mentioned that our reviews would help other songkickers decide whether it's worth seeing Coldplay live and my answer is hell yes! The experience was fantastic, the lights were amazing and the band really knows how to include their fans into the show. I've loved their music for quite some time and being a part of such an incredible adventure was the highlight of the past few years. Chris has the most amazing and reassuring voice and he sings just as awesome live as he does recorded. It was a beautiful evening and I'm very greatful to be a part of Coldplay's tour 2016. :)"
"Head Full of Dreams in the Singapore National Stadium is the best concert we've ever seen -- BAR NONE! We stood up at the VIP standing pen for almost 4 hours including the front act. Jess Kent was also amazing so we didn't mind the initial wait. Afterwards the magic of the main act stage slowly unfolded. We didn't realize we will not only be given an aural treat, but also visual and interactive plays during the concert. Awesome music, performance and a magical audience was all that we needed to sustain our energy for the night -- no matter all the sweat, pushing and shoving we took on as part of it. Coldplay simply ROCKS!"
An amazing and almost epic experience.
Really fun and entertaining concert despite the rain and being Sunday night!!!
"Drake's energy on the stage is just incomparable to anybody I've seen. The way he connects with the crowd is unbelievable. I think that his energy on stage just get the crowd more hyped up so it's an all around good show whenever Drake performs.    From ""So Far Gone"" to ""Nothing Was The Same,"" his style and the way he gets his message across have stayed the same. That's the best thing about aging, you get better as time progresses and I think that his albums are a definite reminder of how lyrically and musically talented he is. Many artist make one or two good albums, maybe a song or two every now and then, but Drake has consistently been at the top releasing good music and is just on fire. It's easier to get to the top than to stay there, but he's proving to everyone that he has enough to get to the top and knock anyone down who try's to take him down."
"I have never been a huge fan of Drake, but after becoming hooked on the 2013 song ‘Hold on we’re going home’, I decided to check out his back catalogue of work, and was really surprised with what I found, and immediately regretted discounting him previously."
I bought my tickets to Lil Wayne VS. Drake about 4 months ago and finally got to attend the show on Saturday. Wow. My mind was blown. First of all G-Easy Opened for them and really got the crowd warmed up for the headliners. The whole show was like a video game with Drake and Lil Wayne going back and forth with old and new hits which I was so impressed with how they really mixed it up. Drake flew above the crowd suspended holding on to a stripper pole looking stand which Lil Wayne later dogged on him for. They battled back and forth about being the most featured artist and at the end I had chills because they were both saying how grateful they were for keeping each other's music alive. It was inspiring and poetic. I was impressed it was definitely the best show I have been to this year!
"Drake puts on a great show, honestly a great performer who is very talented."
"Tickets were very expensive. This was one of the most I have ever paid for a concert ticket, need to make it affordable for his fans. His stage presence was brilliant and loved how much he relates himself to the UK and a personal bond with Birmingham. He did lots of his lesser successful songs which was disappointing, songs like crew love which lots of his fans LOVE came on for 10 seconds then he switched into another one. Just felt it lacked real good performances of his better known and his best songs."
"I really liked the show! Drake was an amazing entertainer and made me feel seen and made the show worthwhile. He really suprised me in a positive way:) I loved the sequals were he talked between the songs and the drirecting of scenery was incredible. Some of the most impressive stuff I have ever seen on a stage. He was a good singer, and I liked his tribute to Rihanna. Thanks Drake, for an awesome experience. You are way coolet than I thought"
One of the best concerts I've been to in a while...   Then opening act: party next door wasn't very well known  But when the main acts got on stage the party was really bumpin.   Great set list. I can say that I was standing and dancing the whole night and rapping along. They had an interactive portion to help decide who won the rap battle between Drake and Lil Wayne through a downloaded app on your phone. Overall awesome experience!
"Amazing preformance! He's very enganging and interactive with the crowed, not to mention insanely talented! There was a really cool moving light show (globes of lights that were lowered and raised to create patterns above the audiance as well as change colors). Would have loved to hear more from some of his first albums but all in all a fantastic show. Definatly was worth spending the extra money for floor seats :)"
The Drake vs Lil wayne show was definantly a must see! The whole competitive feel of them trying to one up eachother really drove the energy up! Drake is amazing live but honestly Lil Wayne stole the show for me. Also the production value is through the roof! It's less of a concert and more of an experience! They played all of their hits as well as their old stuff! Definantly get a seat to this one!
Drake was unbelievable on a whole his chats in between the songs conveyed important messages and overall he was just so unbelievable to see live I would 100% recommend. He even took someones Odell Beckham Jr Jersey from them when walking to the stage and got it signed by Odell Beckham Jr and then gave it back to him. Inspiration and truly amazing man.
The show was soo good. The firsts parts were too long but when Drake arrived the stage was on fire and everybody was singing all his songs. He said also a lot of beautiful things about how the world is today and this was so emotional. I really want to go again to his concert if he'll come in a few years.That was a fucking good experience damn it!
"I was so annoyed that he rescheduled the show and then on top of that, he didn't come on stage until close to 10pm. But he made up for it with a great show and he brought out Trey Songz, Giggs, Skepta, Popcaan and Nicki Minaj."
My first real concert and I am not disappointed at all. He is such a great artist and it was literally one of the best nights of my life. There's no difference when he sings on stage to on the songs that are recorded. I can't explain how happy I was and I had such a great time. I can't wait for him to come back one more time as he said. #6god
"Amazing!!!! Way above any expectations I had of the show! Not only was the music great and Drake's voice even greater (live!!), him as an entertainer was really impressive. The way he interacted with the audience and spoke to ALL of us was so enjoyable."
Great setlist. A good balance whithin his repertoire. He played some hits for the girls and others for the boys but in general the setlist was built to turn up the audience. Visually it was interesting. Quite impressing. Glad to see that he brought some real musicians with him (drummer and keyboards player) besides his DJ.
"The show was amazing and was definitely worth every cent! Drake and Migos put on a great show, however there was a long wait. We had to wait almost two hours after the time the concert was supposed to start, but I mean the show made up for it and Drake went past the time it was supposed to end and gave us our moneys worth."
I was really excited before the concert. Drake delayed the concert by a month promising a spectacular production. I hate that it was on Monday but the production was indeed spectacular. Drake was late by 40 minutes but he also ended up playing 40 more minutes. Next time though he could talk less and start the mosh sooner.
"I love Drake's concerts, the energy and the performance he brings on stage is amazing. No wonder he is one of the best rappers we have. I always get t-shirts with his lyrics and get so many compliments at his concerts. If you guys want to get his typographical lyrics printed on a shirt go to albumapparel.com/"
I attended the show on a Saturday night and wasn't expecting much from the 6 God except for good bars.
Awesome concert! The guy is a MF performer!
"“EMINEM.”    Seeing his name lit across the stage was mind blowing. As if natural instinct, everyone started chanting, ‘EM-IN-EM, EM-IN-EM’, until the legend himself took the stage, wearing a get up that only the King of Rap could pull off."
"Eminem in concert in LA was enough to make me extraordinarily happy, but for him to perform some hits from the Recovery album made the entire night absolutely worth it!! It was nostalgic for him to perform his old hits, taking me back to elementary and junior high school days, but Recovery was the album that solidified my love and appreciation for his artistry, talent and heart!"
"I have been a huge Eminem fan since he came out with Cleaning Out My Closet, I was very very young at the time so I've been a fan since I was a little kid. I was very much looking forward to my first Eminem concert, and on 8/16 at MetLife Stadium, my dream finally came true.  The website said they would start at 7:30, but they didn't start until like 8:40, but the whole concert made up for it.   Eminem was amazing, I honestly have no words to describe the experience except that it was very unreal and I had to pinch myself a few times just to make sure this was really happening to me. He played a lot of his songs off his first two albums and then some songs off of Recovery & MMLP2.   For anyone who had seats or had Floor B GA, you really missed out on an amazing view & concert. The view from the 200s & 300s probably sucked, they could only probably see Eminem & Rihanna from the jumbo screens.  Rihanna was great too, she was very sweet & funny live, as well as sexy & seductive.  Eminem was funny and his stage presence was wonderful.  This was an experience I'd LOVE to have again, an experience many should get to enjoy and from the amazing view in GA. I do hope he goes on tour again in the next year or so."
"Fucking amazing!! Man’s music has saved my life so many times! A real artist and an incredible lyricist... unbaleaveablw how much talent Marshal has. Tears dropped as he sung songs that touched my heart and took me back from the grave... I love him for all he has done for me an my recovery... if only I was able to thank him in person... In rehab they say to believe in power that’s greater than me, as my god. Eminem is that god to me. A powerful man that I know has saved so many lives just from his music. The show was the best show I’ve ever attended. Only issue was I wasn’t quick enough to get a ticket I the pit. I would have rocked up at 6am before the concert just to get into the front row and thank the ma. For everything he has done for my life.."
"I have been a fan of Eminem in 1999, I was leaving 4 meps,right be4 basic training and i was getting picked up at 11am, and i was drinking about 6am and in Chicago there was a video channel that played diff videos 24/7 around 6ish am i saw his video i just don't give af,and i was like hell ya a white boy.Then in basic on a Sunday while some people went 2 church i snuck outta the barreks and bought a walk men cd player and they had the SSLP there so i grabbed that,and that helped get me threw basic training, and when i got 2 my unit i bought a z28 97,and got a system put in it and the MMLP came out and the bass use 2 make my whip shake,but i no lots of what he talks about cuz ive had so many close friends get killed  in drive buys lots i no that oded,i was hooked on pills,lot of what he says i feel, like i was the only white kid growing up in my part of chi,so ive been a stan sence be4 stan ever came out, EMIN3M 4LIFE.

"Where do I start, right let’s try.... I’ve been lucky enough to see Eminem 3 Times now, first time was v festival where he was absolutely superb and stole the show. Second was at Wembley, where yet again he smashed it, and too bring out dre was unbelievable and the crowd went insane, personally thought, u are not topping that.... but now to twickenham, where I didn’t think he could possibly get any better or fulfill his thousands and thousands of fans, but how stupid was I haha, not only delivers the best show/concert I’ve ever been to and seen but upped the anti and performs the best I’ve ever seen and I’ve seen a few acts, not to finish there, but brings out not just 50 cent but ed sheeran also and the crowd just goes insane and lifted the roof off...."
"I FINALLY got to see Eminem live after being a fan since day one. What can I say that will do the performance justice? He was AMAZING! Everything that I ever imagined in my mind an Eminem concert would be, well it was 10 times better than that. He was on point with his flow, the sound was awesome, the stage design was great too but honestly I didn't even pay that much attention to that because I was focusing on him the entire time. It was a long time coming for me to see him live and man did he exceed my expectations. Few shows have ever hit that top mark for me and wow he did it. There really are no words that I can say that will give him the credit he deserves for being an amazing artist and performer. All I can say is if you get a chance to watch him, DO IT! You will not be disappointed. I can't wait to be able to watch him again!"
"Marshal a.k..a Eminem, you are the best music star ever! I listen to your music everyday becuase I love how you put your anger and pain into the words of your songs, ""I'm Sorry Mama, I never meant to hurt you, I never meant to make you cry"" is one of the best emotional phrases you have used even though you think you have hurt them they will always love you and make sure you are safe. I will always buy your albums when they are released and even try and come to one of your concerts, hopefully meaning I get to meet you and ask for a picture with you and ask you nicely to sign my albums and posters I have. You are my favourite singer of all time. I am your biggest fan ever!"
"Eminem is epic. Eminem live is mind blowing!   Live he performs a great variety of songs from all of his albums, mixing in some of his old stuff which brings feelings of nostalgia with his newer stuff which sounds great.   He has got to be one of the best rappers of all time and the fact that he writes all his lyrics himself gives the songs depth and meaning. He's a lyrical genius!   Watching him live is a roller coaster of emotions from jumping up and down and going wild to swaying your hands in the air with a sing-a-long.   Even though Wembley held thousands he still performed like it was to each and every one of you, interacting with the crowd and showing off his great sense of humor.  Eminem is amazing and I would highly recommend seeing him live, there's no feeling like it."
"Phenomenal. Just as with his Wembley Stadium show 4 years prior, Eminem executed a powerful performance of a diverse array of classics spanning his whole career. He demonstrated why he is heralded by many as not only the greatest Hip Hop artist of all time, but one of the most iconic artists in music still today. Seeing him reunite with 50 Cent on stage was a fan-pleasing nostalgia trip of legend. Ed Sheeran, Royce Da 5'9 and Skylar Grey also helped to light the stage and prestige even further. This was the perfect experience for Slim Shady fans. Utterly remarkable."
"I am very very anxious to see him soon I hope!!! Listen to him as long as I can remember his first album!!! I pray he comes somewhere near ALABAMA soon!!! It would make my millennium!!!! If u see this M, I want u to know that I am a 43 year old man and I been listening to you forever it seems like and would love for my wife and I to see u live!!!! Keep on keeping on! You r my favorite music artist! God really gave u a talent that I wish I could have! Good luck with the rest of your career and God bless!"
Considering I have been a massive fan of Eminem since I was introduced to his music at the tender age of Seven; I believe I did a great job of staying calm.
"Absolutely amazing, the energy he put off was incredible."
"An amazing and energic concert. An amazing feeling and Im soo moved. The downside thought is the arena which isn't the best one for the viewrs, from a big areana where you almost can see the stage whater your 400meters from the stage on the side or the oposite side of the arena, the sound isn't really the best either and the caos when 57000 people are trying to get out and you get stuck and can't move. But other than that it's a 10 out of 10"
"It was absolutely amazing... It was Eminem and Rihanna on August 17th. They were half an hour late which is fine. The production was amazing, Rihanna is a goddess and Eminem is a god. Everything was perfect, the set list had everything it should. MetLife Stadium is a great venue as well. Unfortunately the transportation back to NY was chaotic, but far from spoiling what an amazing concert we had. Truly amazing"
"Seeing Eminem is a dream that every person that's grown up in the 90's wishes to tick off their bucket list! Seeing him last year at reading was amazing, 50,000+ people singing along to every word of his songs! I can't explain how euphoric it was! and with his return to wembley this year I'm sure it'll be just as crazy as last year! Can't wait!"
I haven't seen him but love his music I relate to it I'm 52 but when I'm 70 I'll still lission to him. I'm in Iowa cedar rapids I'm begging him to come here he has a lot of fans here. So if u see this please come to the us cellular center here 52402 in Iowa so I can come see u please love u your biggest fan anna
We had a lot of fun
"It was perfect!! I like that security staff was very friendly and reacting so quickly if something were going wrong. WC were really very clean. We were stayed in the first line so our shoes were dry, so we were lucky because it was raining a little bit."
"Sometimes when you hear a band that you love perform live for the first time, you're a bit disappointed because they do not sound as great as they do in the recordings. Well, that is NOT the case with Maroon 5, what you hear on recording is what you get live."
"Maroon 5 have been constant and consistent in the charts over their long career which now spans almost fifteen years. The band, fronted by Adam Levine has come along way since the immediate success with 'Songs For Jane'. Now working on their sixth album, they obtain a consistency within their live show to match."
"This is my second show in the last 2 years and neither time was I disappointed in the least.  This time I was fortunate enough to have the money I saved to purchase pretty good seats. I am now spoiled and can no longer sit in the stands.  I am already saving my money for the next US tour in hopes to be even closer next show.  No matter where your seats though....Adam is all over the stage in high energy, which is very infectious!!  Anyone who did not enjoy that show, must not have been paying attention.  They sounded awesome live...awesome!!  Adam made the audience feel as though they were part of the show and VERY, VERY much appreciated!  The lights were perfect, the set list was awesome as well.  They played much longer than most people expected and the encore was just as great as the rest of the show, maybe even better.  Maybe that is because I am partial to ""Moves Like Jagger"" and there it was....This was worth every dollar I paid, which was way more than I would pay to see anyone but maroon 5!!  If  you get a chance to see them sometime....make it a point....you will fall in love!!"
"IT WAS SOOOOOO AMAZING. they played all the songs i grew up listening to so all the memories just came flooding in and it was simply the best experience EVERR! seeing my favs live in concert was so LIT. What Lovers Do, Payphone, Maps, Cold, Sugar, Sunday Morning, Wait, Girls Like You, This Love AND MOVES LIKE JAGGER WOOO these are all my favourites and they played all of them AND MORE!!! i can’t barely describe how amazing this experience was. i was a bit upset that they didn’t perform an encore and some songs from the album that i really thought would be played like Help Me Out and Whiskey. from what my sister told me, Maroon 5 performed an encore last time round so i was quite let down when the concert ended without an one this time. nevertheless, it was a still a fantastic performance and i really hope to see them again soon!!!"
"No food allowed into the event, and the only food available from vendors was junk food (3-4 different pizza vendors, 2-3 sub vendors), not 1 single option for those wishing to eat healthy (not even a freaking salad was available anywhere)."

I've been waiting to see Maroon 5 for 6 years and I'm so glad I finally did it.
"The band was really good at times, but Adam Levine did not seem to be at his best. Entire show including encore was 1:20. No real effects, which is ok, if the music is great, but no one was super impressed with the performance. Maybe an off day. If you are thinking about getting the VIP package- DON'T! Complete rip off and Maroon 5 and VIP Nations EU should be ashamed. Grocery bag with Maroon 5 on it, a lanyard, a silk screen pillow (seriously), and cheap sunglasses. No band photos, certainly no pictures with you and the band, no autographed anything. Complete and utter SH*T for your extra money. They also made us wait outside for 35 minutes, 28 degree heat, beyond their published entrance opening, no apology. Awful!"
"Third try: Songkick doesn't want any bad reviews. Maroon 5 was nothing spectacular. Adam Levine seemed to be off and sometimes stopped singing in the middle of the song. Entire set was 1hour 20 minutes, including encore. VIP package was a total rip off. Small cloth bag with Maroon 5 on the side, an ugly silk screen Maroon 5 pillow (really?), a lanyard, and cheap sunglasses. No autographed anything, no picture of the band, no picks, nothing to make you feel you got something special. The band and VIP Nation EU should be ashamed! They also made the ""VIPs"" wait for 35 minutes outside in 28 degree heat. This was beyond their published doors opening time and no apology. DO NOT waste your money on this."

I'm sure it was a fantastic concert.  I had grabbed two great seats back on the first day they went on sale.
"I missed them every time they came to Toronto. Finally got to see them live and it was everything I thought it would be. The band was top notch, the stage setup was simple but it gave such a different look. Minus the little mini blackout and tantrum that Adam had (he also threw the mic on the floor and it inadvertently hit a fan on the head - she was fine) Adam was nice enough to pull her on stage and apologize even though we couldn't hear a single thing lol"
"No meu ponto de vista a participação do D J no início foi longa demais, o que só aumentou nossa espera e ansiedade pra ver o Maroon5. O local onde estava extremamente organizado e foi possível a todos os presentes curtir uma apresentação incrível com um setlist muito bacana de musicas “novas” e as mais “antigas” . Pra mim foi um puta show e com certeza vale muito a pena! Levine no palco é demais assim como todos os integrantes, sempre se movimentando e fazendo brincadeiras entre eles e com o público. Concerto extremamente recomendado!"
"A performance da banda foi maravilhosa. Nota 1000!!! Apenas gostaria de deixar uma sugestão para os organizadores do evento com relação à disposição do local. Já foi a shows no Jeunesse Arena antes e o espaço fechado é mais apropriado para esse tipo de evento devido ao calor da cidade do Rio de Janeiro, a possibilidade de contemplar o show das cadeiras, a proteção no caso de chuva e o ar condicionado que com certeza beneficia o músico/banda que não está acostumado com nosso calor. Ao Maroon Five: come back anytime you want!"
"I expected so much! I loved Maroon 5 and Adam Levine and their songs will stay in my heart even after this big disappointment. I was looking ahead for jokes, connection with us (the public), even a 'Hello, Bucharest' would have made me happy. Instead, we got a cold and arrogant attitude, no more than 100 words addressed to us during the entire show, and some 'We love you, you're extraordinary, we'll be back' thrown in our faces at the end. Duty fulfilled, paycheck cashed in. They did not deserve the public they got! Yes, Mommy, yes!"
"Great concert Loved the energy and sound. The engagement with the audience was wonderful not too forced. Only thing I didn't like was the playlist of songs. Really wished they would have done some of their other music.  Like ;Little of your time, Stutter, Shudder, Tangled, Man who never lied, Let's stay together, and If I ain't got you. Adams voice in the last two songs sounds like velvet.  Will see them again. TOV Lo was very good  R City ok didn't know much of their music they sing."
"WOW!!!!  We had fantastic seats near the stage however, wherever you were sitting/standng you experienced a great concert.  Adam sang non-stop for the first 20mins or so and what a voice!!  He included all their classics - payphone, jagger etc as well as their current album.  And to top it at the end, they had decided to film their next video - such fun.  Great night, amazing concert, perfect venue!  Want to do it all again asap!"
The most Fun concert ever! This was the  third time I brought my niece to see Maroon 5. We were singing and dancing the entire concert. The most entertaining and highly energetic performance with amazing vocals. I have been a fan for many years and I love sharing the experience with my niece who is equally appreciative. Thank you for setting the bar for our concert going experiences for 2015. Much love from Minneapolis.
"so good. I sat up in the top section, but the view was still incredible and my friend and I had an amazing time. the lights added onto the emotion of each song. I cried during Sunday Morning, just because it was amazing to finally hear such an important song to me live. Adam's beautiful. There was a drunk girl who jumped up on stage and tried to kiss him, but other than that, it was a flawless concert."
Boooring!!!
"Great show! I bought my wife and I tickets as a gift for her (she was a huge Ed Sheeran fan even before he was famous) and we had a great time. My wife had never been to the venue, and while I had been to shows at Consol Enery Center before this was the first show I saw there since it became PPG Paints Arena. Everything about the production and performances (lights, audio, visuals, crew, musicians etc) went off with nary a hitch and was executed in a very timely manner. Props to all involved."
"It is safe to say that Ed Sheeran will be one of the defining artists of our generation. His music transcends any definable genre, combining soft folk with bright pop and grime hip-hop. Sheeran's clever wordplay and soulful lyrics are able to really captivate an audience, both when listening to him live or on a CD. One of the most salient qualities about him though, is his pure, unaltered, truly beautiful voice.    It is hard to really visualize how great he sounds until you see him live. I was lucky enough to see him at a small, intimate performance with a crowd of only about 100. The first thing you notice about him is that it is just him up on stage. There is no band, no backing vocals, no track playing in the background or anything. It is him, a guitar, and a loop pedal. From the moment he struck the first chord until the moment he stepped off stage, the audience was enchanted by him. His voice can transport you from an old pub in Ireland to the grimy streets of London without ever missing a beat. A real troubadour, his shining moments are the ballads in which soaring vocals and romantic lyrics backed by the simple strum of his Little Martin cause major swooning."
Let me just start off by saying Ed Sheeran is an amazing performer and speaker. He is comedic and doesn't require thousands of lights and a massive stage to impress thousands. He stayed interactive with the crowd very well. This is my 3rd concert ever and it was both the best and worst I have ever.
"Ed was fantastic! He played with no band or backtrack, but instead recorded himself and looped it as he went along to create the illusion of a backtrack or band. With only one person on stage in such a huge arena, there was a lot of opportunity to for the show to grow dry or redundant, especially for those sitting far away. However, he managed to keep me entertained the whole show with an AMAZING graphic show to accompany him. Each of his songs had a unique visual and light show that included scenes from music videos, new visuals, and video to project his performance. There was so much to look at I didn't even mind sitting far away (second level)."
"I have seen 300 concerts. This evening is in my top ten. The sheet quality of his songs, what he achieves with his looping, and the visuals on the screen were excellent. There were a few occasions during the night when Ed was bashing away at his guitar, lost in that massive cacophony,of sound, that I thought that the Budweiser Gardens might blast off into space! Excellent."
"I don't know if it was the galavanting with Taylor Swift, but I know what you are thinking… Ed Sheeran is a ginger with a One Direction pre-teen fanatic following, and I'm not sure if I want to experience that live. Well I am here to tell you, you do. You really need to see Ed Sheeran live the next chance you get."
After a 4.5hr drive to see the show we weren’t disappointed!
"Seeing Ed Sheeran live was an incredible experience. Ed is not just a singer, but a brilliant artist, because every song of his is a work of art. He is 23 years old and he has released two albums, twelve EPs and collaborated with many successful artists."
"I fell in love with Ed's music a few years ago, a little before the big hype about him (of which there is every need to be). I loved his first album and all his ""old"" songs (pre-+) like ones in The songs I wrote with Amy and X (Mulitply) is just even better.  I knew he would be amazing live, because any live lounges or live performances I've watched of his have been brilliant.  What I love is that it's just him, his guitar and his loop pedal – no band or back-up singers which is something quite unique to him. That, I think, makes a more personal connection with him and the crowd so, even parents who didn't particularly want to be there could be involved as well with clapping etc.  He seems really genuine and down-to-earth through his performances too as he doesn't have anything too flashy – just a couple screens behind him so everyone can see him. And of course, just jeans and a t-shirt.  He had a good mix of up-beat and slow songs and songs with a slow start and build up which I really liked. He also added things to the songs like adding other parts of songs to the end or adding an extra verse than from what's on the album (eg. You need me, I don't need you).  His love performance consisted mostly of songs from his new album, X but also many songs from + and a few older songs too like Gold Rush.  I was definitely recommend listening to and going to a concert of Ed's because his music is for everyone and he is definitely a crowd-pleaser."
"James Blunt was the opening act, with Ed Sheeran as the main.  The show started right on time, which doesn't always happen in my experience. Blunt had a hit with ""Beautiful"" in the states a while back and we haven't heard much from him since, so he poked fun at himself on stage and put on a great show. The crowd may have come to see Ed Sheeran, but Blunt set a great mood for the rest of the show, ending with an upbeat song.  He is the self proclaimed singer of ""miserable songs"", yet he ended his set on a positive note and crowd participation."
"Ed Sheeran is probably the most talented man alive, thought surprisingly not many people know about Ed Sheeran. He is a singer song writer with an incredible voice who stands on stage with a guitar and a loop pedal. He builds the music right in front of you, singing the background melodies and strumming the guitar until the music is perfect and than he starts singing his songs. This is my third time seeing Ed Sheeran, and it won't be my last. The ""Ginger Jesus"" as many fans call him opened with ""I'm a Mess"" which is one of my personal favorites. He continued building beats and playing my favorite songs throughout the whole night and there was never a boring moment. Another personal favorite is when Ed (he's soo cute) requests the crowd to be completely silent, no singing, NO SCREAMING, and no talking. Eventually the crowd quiets down and everyone is shushing each other while he beautifully sings ""Afire Love"" which is a song he wrote in tribute to his grandfather. The concert went by so fast and we were suddenly chanting for ""More Ed"". Naturally, he came back and gave us the most incredible performance I have ever seen in my life singing ""You Need Me, I Don't Need You"" I can't even describe it. Of course he sang A-Team, which is such a beautiful song and ""Sing"". Ed Sheeran is so humble and honestly, one of the most talented people of our generation."
"It takes a lot of talent to make grown men squeal like teenage girls at a concert but Ed Sheeran did just that.   From the second he walks on stage the energy in the room changes. From first sight of that ginger hair the entire crowd went insane. The relation between the venue size and the amount of noise that was being produced was astounding. However, his cool presence can also make an entire room go silent. It takes true talent to quiet a room of teenage girls.    On the other hand, the audience that his music appeals to was various. Although I arrived at 7:30 am for the general admission show (which started at 7pm) there were also many older fans and an almost even ration of male to female.   You can tell by his expressions ( and the countless ""thank-you's) that Ed is truly grateful to be where he is today. The way he gets the crowd involved is unbelievable. He has them sing the back up vocals while he plays the loop pedal and sings lead. This one man can create the sounds of an entire band. At various times throughout the show I stopped singing along just to hear his amazing voice and take in what was actually happening in front of my eyes.   Closing the show with his latest hit ""Sing"", he left the crowd singing all the way into their cars. Never have I seen such a genuine performer with such talent. X."
"After seeing Ed live, I've fallen 100 times more in love with him. Wembley Stadium is a big place so I was initially concerned that my seat was too far away from all the excitement (as it was in the back half of the stadium and highest level of assigned seating) however I was grateful to find this was wrong as Sheeran's stage presence captured the entire stadium. His warm up acts- Foy Vance and One Republic- were also brilliant. One of the first things Sheeran said upon coming onto the stage was that no one cares what you're doing so dance like crazy and everyone has to lose their voice by the end of the show; despite the size of his audience, it was comforting to be spoken to almost as an individual. Many of his songs had a faster tempo than recorded on the CD which made them far more exciting, for example, one of my favourites, 'I'm a mess'. He gave an emotional performance of 'Afire love' from his second album for which he introduced as a ""very personal (song) to (him)"". I think many people connect more to artists like Sheeran because of the whole-heartedness and sincerity of his shows."
"I'm so glad I went to see Ed Sheeran perform live! I'd watched a couple of videos on Youtube of past concerts, so I knew that he would put on a good show, but it was better than I even expected."
"Well, I'm french so I apologize for my bad English."
Small intimate venue for a special night with Ed Sheeran.
"Ed Sheeran is an amazing entertainer. He possesses the rare ability to stand alone on a stage in front of thousands with just a guitar, microphone, and looping station. He travels lightly, requiring no band or moving stage parts. His intricate melodies are never the same in two shows. Sheeran mashes songs up, sneaks in a classic or two, and incorporates lyrics from current hits. He constantly keeps his fans engaged, giving them harmony parts to repeat, and even gets chaperoning parents tapping their feet to the beat. The diversity of the Suffolk singer's fans is incredible, ranging from fangirling tweens to accompanying husbands and boyfriends who do not initially expect to enjoy the event. ""The Man"" is a musical genius, able to easily transition from a quiet love song to an exhilerating rap, leaving the room ""Drunk"" with anticipation for what is coming next. He can please a crowd just as well as, if not better than, a seasoned performer with a full band, props, and costumes. Most amazingly, he remains humble and true to his roots, a normal twenty-four year old, refusing to let the fame go to his head. Sheeran paints a picture that is most definitely worth witnessing."
"It has been an incredible show! It was my first concert, I didn't know that this could such a great emotion to feel under the skin. My heart had an earthquake literally,it was that kind of emotion that rips out your soul and sews it with new pieces filled with that music that has conquered your everything. Ed Sheeran has an incredible voice, he's an angel on this earth and, with his wings, he generates the will to fly. I've been lucky for having the possibility to go to his concert and it has been and always will be the best event of this year and my life. Anytime now that I listen to his songs, I cry, but those tears are filled with happiness. It's been the first time in my life that I wept with joy! I'm not a lukcy girl and, for once in my life, I felt so well and I still feel well, I feel that, from now on, everything will be okay.This concert changed my life, Ed Sheeran saved me! Ed Sheeran is a superhero for me, he has the power to make people believe that this Earth is the most beautiful place to belong to. He'll be for eva in my heart, every beat has a musical note of his songs, his music pumps in my bloodstream, he's perfect to me!"
"Ed Sheeran at Wembley was absolutely incredible. I have no words to describe how much fun me and my boyfriend had. Starting from the fact that both of his opening acts, Jamie Lawson and Anne-Marie, were both amazing and full of energy, I think the capacity that Ed has of putting on a show in front of 100,000 people with only his voice and his guitar are beyond words. Even though I was a tad disappointed because there was not a special guest, differently from the nights before where Stormzy and Andrea Bocelli joined on stage, I had a great time and sang and danced to every song. Ed was very interactive and we all had a laugh when he made jokes and it was nice to see how passionate he is when he performs. He genuinely wants every single person to have a good time and spend those couple of hours with a constant smile on the face. I felt a bit emotional when he sang some songs like Lego House or Photograph, and I danced and jumped during Nancy Mulligan. I am very grateful for getting to see him, especially on such a massive tour. Definitely would recommend to anyone and would see him again any time!"
"Hi, my name is Bianca and I am here to tell you about my experience at Divide Tour Brazil in Belo Horizonte."
"I went to a Bruno Mars concert last night, and I thought it was great. When I first got there, everyone was really hyped up and excited, and the mood was contagious. The merchandise were cool, though it was very expensive (but what else do you expect at a concert?). Aloe Blacc went on before Bruno and sang some of his famous songs, and later came out to sign autographs.  When Bruno finally came out, he did so with a big bang (literally, it sounded like a gunshot). Throughout the concert, he remained energetic, and would  also stop every once in a while to talk to the audience. He made the audience feel like he was glad to be there and was having a good time with us.   Bruno Mars' sings many types of genres, including pop, reggae, soul, R&B, and pop rock. He has many different and original songs, one about getting his money stolen to another upbeat song about being lazy. Some of his more recent songs have a few cuss words, for example his song Gorilla. He made sure to sing the songs with cuss words toward the end of the concert, when all of the younger kids would have most likely left already. He actually surprised the audience quite a bit with this. He had a fake ending; said goodnight and thank you for coming, and 5 minutes later came back out and sang some of his expletive songs.  Overall I loved this concert, and I highly recommend you go too!"
"There is no doubt that Bruno Mars is one of the top male singers today. And if you haven't been to see him in concert, you're really missing out. His live performances are extremely entertaining."
"The Bruno Mars concert was seriously phonominal. He is such a great performer and a great singer. He's so so so good live. Him and the hooligans are amazing. They're really funny and they dance a lot and it's so good! I really think that man can do anything and pull it off. If you go to the concert you will not regret or forget it. It's so memorable and such a great time. There are lots of suprizes during the whole concert and it really keeps you on your feet. He's amazing and if he ever comes back to my city or anywhere near it I'm going to be there. He did a variety of different songs. He did reggae, his slow songs, his faster songs (like Natalie, Gorilla, etc). He even covered some songs (like bump and grind and other classics) he didn't sing the whole songs but he did the best parts of the songs he covered and mixed it together. It's very hard to explain but that was very memorable. There was singing, fire, glitter confetti, dancing, Bruno Mars and the Hooligans... What else could you want? Did you know in Honolulu Hawaii where 'Bruno' was born as 'Peter Gene Bayot Hernandez'? Hope you go to the 'Moonshine Jungle Tour because it's amazing! Have fun!"
"Overall, the Bruno Mars concert was an incredible experience. The fact that he could sing like a dove, play a mean guitar lick, AND dance his pants off - all at the same time - blew me away. I was kept entertained all night long."
"This concert was perhaps one of the best concerts I've been to and that says a lot since I just turned 59 and 365 days (it's still difficult for me to admit that I'm X0 years old.... I saw Jimmie Hendrix in concert, Moody Blues, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, Cream, Miranda Lambert, Lady Antebellum, Jason Aldean, Siberian Orchestra, Johnny Mathis and many many more artists and this concert ranked in the top 5. The dancing was fantastic, his stage presence and how he played with the crowd (mostly the ladies) was FUN!!!!  His drum solo-words cannot describe it... I only wish I could see him tonight in Milwaukee (I live in Wisconsin) at Summerfest tonight.  I would go again to see him....Aloe Blacc was great also!!!!! Thanks for asking."
"The Bruno Mars concert was amazing! The only fault that I would say is that there was a lot of waiting Dua Lipa was right on time and it felt like when’s Bruno coming?! Then after Dua Lipa we had to wait for them to set Bruno up which felt like forever, but when he was out there it was amazing he had fireworks and amazing dance moves and his singing was just amazing. He even added some comedy in there, and he was putting his absolute all you could see by the sweat on his body. After we thought it was over but he surprised us with an extra song :) it was an experience of a lifetime and I must say for my first concert it was A M A Z I N G ! For the merchandise I feel some of it was just a bit overpriced like the hats."
"I spent $256 on a ticket and flew from Florida to Las Vegas to see this fiasco of a show. The show was supposed to start at 9. The curtain finally rose at almost 9:30. The drums and bass were so loud, little of the vocals could be heard. The band was off several times, there was limited choreography, 2 solos (drum and piano, neither of which were Bruno, OBVIOUS TIME FILLERS), and the show lasted one hour and 15 minutes. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!!! IT SUCKED!! I am used to hearing songs sung at concerts, not stopped mid-way to laugh and joke. Bruno Mars needs to go to some REAL concerts so he can see how to please his PAYING AUDIENCE. Go get some lessons from Pink, Elton John, who ever, Bruno, cause your show is a joke!!"
"It was an absolutely amazing night! The performance was stunning and the atmosphere was filled with laughter and happiness. Bruno Mars did an incredible job, by making sure everybody was having a party, and you could just see how much he loved standing on that scene and singing to the crowd. Also I am not going to forget Anderson.Paak who played just before Bruno went on stage. Andersson.Paak made sure, that everyone were ready for the big party, and he too is an incredible musician. Bruno Mars even learned how to say ""I love you"" in danish, which made us feel even closer to him. I will never forget this night!"
It was awesome!!!!!
The concert was AWESOME! The opening person was really good and did a lot with the audience. She talked to the people not as a pop star but as a person. Her song choices really set the mood and went from sad songs to happy songs and did a outstanding job. For Bruno Mars him self did super good. His back up people were an awesome addition to the show. The record thing was a really cool idea. The show was a little delayed because it didn't start until like 15 after 8. Other than that the show was awesome and set the bar very high for the people after him. love you Bruno Mars
"The show was good....not great. The tickets were pretty expensive....$200 for the nose bleed seats. The show lasted exactly one hour. I expected more. Don't get me wrong, I was entertained, but I went to see Bruno Mars because I wanted to be blown away. I wasn't. Also, the opening act was Charlie Wilson....not a fan of his so I felt like half money was wasted. When he annouched that Ciara would be opening, I was like yes!! But she didn't. That was pretty disappointing. But like I said, the show was good, but it could have been way better."
"Good things are: Saw him at the Park Theater, MonteCarlo, in Las Vegas--had great seats & my favorite venue. Love Bruno Mars, love his songs. He's a great singer, writer & producer. The energy in the venue was so alive & enjoyed it very much."
"I could see well in the front row of the arena standing, but because of the standing I had a close contact with people around me, I never thought that I would not like the standing seat. The show was awesome. His voice was very nice, and the members were also the highest peak. It was truly a level high. It is an artist who wants to go again. Next time I would like to see a show overseas. It will be different from Japan."
Showmanship = On Point
"Bruno mars is absolutely amazing.  He is the most talented artist I've ever seen in concert.  Not only can he sing, he can dance,  play guitar and drums.  His band is amazing too, they were dancing with him!  He interacted with the audience and really put on an amazing show,  rather then just lip-singing every song. His performance on stage last night was extraordinary,  and I would love to see him again."
"This is the 6th time I have seen him. The difference with this concert was that it was in an open air stadium. The lighting system and fireworks, added to the exitement. The public were good , he was well received."
"Bruno as expected was amazing, other than starting 25minutes late he did not disappoint, a true entertainer. His dance sequences were spot on, he is a mix of James Brown, Prince, Morris Day and the Time. And the Hooligans were right along with him, the song would start and Hooligans would start dancing and he would seamlessly mix in and out with them. A perfect New Year Eve event would see him again."
This concert surpassed all expectations. The whole group were amazing . They all danced from the start to the finish of the concert and that took some doing while playing instruments. Bruno Mars was amazing. He has got fantastic stage presence to start with but has a startling voice. He is a very talented performer. People were on their feet for most of the concert.an exilerating experience. WOW!!!
In a word: totally and utterly 'awesome'
"Simply put it was amazing, great, outstanding."
"I gotta give it to Yeezus. He's still got the juice and for him to pack the 'Bowl' while performing a seven year old album is a testament to that fact. Show started an hour late and I had the feeling there would be some tech glitches, but you definitely couldn't hate on the effort. There was a small orchestra section stage right and on stage left what appeared to be a few DJ's and dudes on drum machines. The center of the stage featured 3 grand white staircases that were reconfigured between songs. There were fireworks at times which didn't quite fit the tone of the album, but who doesn't like fireworks. It was a party atmosphere and I felt a real connection with other fans simply based on the fact that WE LOVE THIS FUCKING ALBUM. We sang, we yelled, we danced, we laughed, and we reminisced about a Kanye that took us back to bring us forward."
"I have never been a person who could pinpoint a moment in which divine providence had played some role in my life. That is, until I saw Kanye."
"Whether his messianic stature is bona fide or self-professed, one thing’s still for certain: an evening with Kanye West will blow your freaking mind."
"The sounds of hydraulic machinery filled Oracle Arena, as the stench of dirt weed mingled with the faux fog that had been pumping into the air over the past two hours. The opening samples of “Father Stretch My Hands Pt. 1” were slowed down and turned elastic, thus leaving alien chemtrails of sound in the wake of the shadowy figure tethered to the hovering spacecraft. With heads upturned in anticipation of first contact, the crowd was lost in darkness. Chants of “Kan-ye! Kan-ye!” filled every empty space, until the object of their affection shone his light down on the chosen few."
"Kanye was a lot more humble than I expected. I've always loved a lot of the lyrics of his songs as they speak about real stuff that's going on, like the media covering up on what's actually important and people higher up trying to make everyone conform.  His concert was better than I thought it would be. He was entertaining, interactive with the crowd, tried to get the people on the floor to start a mosh pit (haha) and he talked about some shit in the media against him that wasn't true.  The massive screen thing he had happening put an interesting twist to seeing Kanye as it was done in like negative colouring and you could only half see him a lot of the time, which was a bit frustrating but also added to the drama of him. I LOVED the freaky masks he wore half the time, very Kanye- all that bling.  He played a good mix of his music from a bunch of new stuff right back to the older stuff. Almost the whole seated crowd were standing the whole time (something I've NEVER seen at a concert)  I have a newfound respect for Kanye West and am really happy I finally got to see him. I'd definitely go back"
it was fucking horrible as shit like really kanye?
"The beginning of the TLOP tour was soo epic ! He plays the extended sample of Father stretch my hands, and when you hear ""If young metro don't trust you"" the whole stadium goes crazy !! If you want to have a top 5 concert experience download the playlist shown below, bump that with your friends the week of the concert and be ready to leave the concert with no voice lol !!!!"
"The Saint Pablo Tour was by far the dopest energy in one place that I have felt at a venue the size of Verizon Center.  The stage was suspended in air and the attendees with floor seats were actually a mosh pit! They stood the entire time fueling the energy as he floated above their heads and out stretched arms.  Everyone in the building stood the entire concert. Everyone.  Though the lights were dim and the big screen had an hallucination type effect, the lyrics and his movement came thru with Kanye precision. I had the time of my life at this concert. The cherry on the top was that I was invited as a surprise from my love.  The hands down best surprise I've ever received!! I love the old Kanye.  I love the new Kanye. I love Kanye. Period."
"Soooooo, about that concert last night..."
What can I say about probably the most talked about person in the media?
"Lit show. He's so great because he didn't need back up, the show was solely him and it was still fire. Some cool lighting but that's it. He spit fire!!!"
"The show was absolutely insane.  I had floor seat, which are a must for the best experience.  The lighting made the whole place seen unreal and magical...  Seeing Kanye West up close to the point where I was right under him in a mosh pit.  The forum venue is great and a perfect size in my opinion.  By far one of the best experiences of my life and for sure the best concert.  Well worth the money for floor seats and I'd pay for it all over again if I could."
"Had to say a really great experience seeing Kanye live. I felt the vibe that he had in his music upfront and personal then listening to his songs on the radio or through my phone. The lights and the moving stage above the people in GA was really well done. Even though it hasn't been the only concert I been to, it was probably the only one I've been to that had the stage move with Kanye on it. Pretty dope! Lots of fun!"
"Amazing show! The greatest concert I've ever been too! The set list took something from just about every album! And his interactions with the fans was incredible. I can tell he really loved his fans, and the city (Sacramento) loved him right back! He played a little bit to long (almost thirty minutes), but that's okay. I was expecting to have long night anyway. Great job!"
"Kanye's concert was amazing from the beginning to end! The lights and special effects were great and he got the crowd involved. He sang older songs as well as new. Half way through the show, he spoke to fans about following your dreams and never giving up, which was inspiring. Definitely an artist I would go and see live again!"
"You can tell he doesn't like to sing his hits. He played niggas in Paris and sang about 5 words of it, while he walked around on stage. Same with all of the lights and power."
Couldn't have been a better show. Music was loud and bumping people were chilling having a good time and Travis Scott made the most of running throught the crowd once or twice. And over a 10/10 show the new stage idea was kinda hard to get used to but either way was really cool to see Kanye as close as he really got
"Amazing performance by an amazing artist, had so much fun ! Even my friend, who barely knew any of the lyrics, said she has the time of her life :) Amazing outfit, fabulous setlist and the performance was lit, couldnt stop dancing and shouting my throat and legs hurt but totally worth both the money and the pain"
"Worse concert ever! Kanye was 1.5 hours late. Only three songs performed. One of those songs was performed twice. Then, there was 30 minutes of Kanye ranting. Then, the show was over. I am a huge fan of Kanye. This was my first and last Kanye concert.  I was very disappointed and upset. Our tickets costed $688."
"This was one of the best concerts I've been too, definitely in my top 5 this year. Despite the 80 min late start, he played for almost 2 hours on a floating stage. Low lights, dim, nothing but Kanye! His set was super amped, he got us all going no matter where u sat; nobody was seated. Loved it!!"
What makes a U2 concert so special? What is it about a U2 show that compels us to travel hundreds and thousands of miles to see virtually the same concert over and over?
"Bom dia,"
"Let me begin with, ""U2 is the greatest band in the universe!"" I have a strong connection with the band as the Joshua Tree tour was the first concert I ever attended back in 1987. 28 years later, they are still the best live band.  I have been very fortunate to have seen them for most of their tours, Elevation, Vertigo, 360 and now ie. I was a broke college student during Zoo and PopMart."
"Great show, very basic staging, which is a nice change of pace for U2 recently. It allowed you to focus on them as a band, 4 guys playing music together."
This show needed to start and finish in darkness to concentrate the mind on the amazing imagery and truly iconic music.
"U2 at Arrowhead Stadium in KC was a musical memory I'll put in my Top 10...so far.  We got parking lot passes from Ticketmaster beforehand to  save $$ & make navigating the throngs of traffic manageble.  We got to the lot about 5:30 p.m.  People had been there tailgating & the lot attendants were very organized, flagging us in to our spot. We immediately headed in to the Stadium so we could check out the U2 merchandise.  Entering was a breeze, even with security, because we had checked online to see what could or couldn't be taken into the Stadium.  The restrictions make lines move much quicker, even with entering through metal detectors.  Walking up the ramp to our seat level was easy.  U2 had merchandise areas set up at more locations, so lines there were less.  The concession places had very friendly attendants.  The stadium seats were very comfortable.  Security was there in abundance & were also helpful & friendly.  Concert acoustics for an open stadium were amazing.  The only downside was the placement of the"
"U2 are a band who have conquered the globe and are considered iconic by fans of most genres. With such staggering reputation it is obviously quite difficult to form a live show of equal stature. Luckily, Bono and co obtain a form of bravado that is required of any iconic band."
"The concert was awesome but the venue was absolute crap!!!!! Paid $264.00 x 2 & a tower was blocking the view depending where the band was standing on the stage. So view blocked. Support act Noel Gallagher couldn’t hear him speak, don’t know what he was saying & sound not too good at all."
"Amazing concert as always. Lot of security at the entrances so it was a little bit slow everything and I was afraid because maybe I couldn't watch Noel Gallagher but organization was clever and started one hour later more or less. Really it was very difficult to be there at 19 with that security level. But everything was perfect. Noel played lot of Oasis songs with classics like Wonderwall, Little by Little or Don't Look Back in Anger. Then with less than 20 minutes delay, U2 came on stage. Larry Mullen started alone in the middle of the scenario situated at the center of the stadium and it all began... Thanks for allow us to remember a great album like Joshua Tree! All the songs in order, side A and side B if you like more the vinyl. And the last part... Amazing with songs like Elevation or Vertigo. And one last surprise... We could listen a new song from the upcoming album, Songs of Experience. No more to say: GREAT AS ALWAYS U2. We love you!"
Best concert I've ever seen and probably will ever see save for another U2 show. No seat was a bad seat as they had a massive 'screen' that spanned roughly half the length and a third of the height of MSG. The screen could be lowered and raised and there was a catwalk inside of it as well as under it on the floor for the band members to move around on. Animations and live videos of the band members playing were projected onto the screen and could be interacted with inside of the screen. I've never seen anything like it.
"U2 is a big part of the history of rock and roll, and music in general. They always have been since I have memory. Their Montreal concert on June 5 did not fall short from other performances over the years. They opened in a simple yet intense manner with three songs from their latest album. They followed with I Will Follow and Gloria, which are of course songs featured in Boy and Gloria, their first two studio albums. They followed with a mix of classic songs with songs from Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience. The show is truly enjoyable even though it lacks classics like With or Without You, Mysterious Ways or New Year's Day. It was a great experience (no pun intended), and I really looking forward to attending another concert soon."
U2 are a mega band and with that they have quite a few critics
"Over the years I never missed a U2 tour concert (and I've seen many several times). I believe this one belongs to my personal top-5. Not only because of the awesome Anton Corbijn made movies, but moreover because of the extremely well played songs. A big compliment for that to all 4, they were all great! But specially for Bono who's voice was superb. In acoustics the Amsterdam Arena is normally a poor venue. But on Sunday, the evening that I was there, the sound was perfect. What else is there to wish in the future? Apart from good healthiness I would say, a nice 10-15.000 spectator venue, without cell phones in the audience, no video walls, but just the U2 music..."
"The O2 arena was a new experience for me.  I'd previously seen U2 only in outdoor stadiums in Auckland and Wellington, New Zealand.  The stage was amazing - I've no idea how they could do that outdoor."
U2 was pretty good if quite formulaic (exactly the same show as 90% of the rest of th I+E Tour). I think they are best when they are lined up in rock-n-roll T formation (Bono in front of Larry with Edge out left and Adam on the right). They used this for Beautiful Day and it was a truly great rock-n-roll moment. Like seeing them rehearsing in Bono's garage on Cedarwood Road...my other favorites were Every Breaking Wave (acoustic) with the Edge on piano and Bono singing and the closer before the encore: With or Without You. I was quite disappointed that this particular show was shorter than all the other ones in this tour.
"Super concert, très bonne ambiance, le show était là avec une super mise en scène qui était bien en lien avec les musiques jouées. Le groupe est vraiment très actif sur scène ce qui rendait le concert d'autant plus vivant."
"It was the best concert I've ever gone to. Edge was amazing with his guitar solos and piano riffs, While Bono energizing the crowd with constant dancing and all of his antics including dancing with a random girl from"
"The audio was amazing, the sound was probably one of the best concerts I've attended. Visually it was bad.  Most of the performance was blocked by the Giants screen in the middle of the stage. If you were seated on the sides of the bowl, your experience was probably fine. However, if you were seated on either end of the Garden, you missed the MAJORITY of the show. Very disappointed that when I bought the tickets there was no disclaimer that the entire show would have an obstructed view. I could only see the band 25% of the time, which is a very bad percentage for a venue like MSG...."
"I have been following and attending U2 live concerts for almost 30 years, and I was a bit doubtful about this tour - the 2015 Innnonce tour didn't give me great emotions."
(Adèle in Ziggodome 6-6-2016)
"The journey from the center of the arena to the main stage was lit by camera phones and shrieks of joy. Once there, “Hello” transitioned into “Hometown Glory”. London landmarks gave way to the Denver skyline, as the lyrics changed from ‘my hometown’ to ‘your hometown.’ What could have come across as gimmicky at some mainstream country show, somehow rang true as an honest tribute to the city in which Adele was an honored guest. The cynic in me didn’t want to show any emotion, but there was something so enchanting about the way she sang “the wonders of my world”, while images of the Rocky Mountains towered above her, that I just couldn’t help myself. It had been less than ten minutes since she had first appeared and I was already powerless against her charm."
"Hi, my history at the concert is really sad...For months I have tried to reunior the value to tell them..i tell you:"
"It is hard to know what to say that hasn't already been said, the list of superlatives has been done and each one is accurate. Adele may be nervous performing live, and there are times where that shows through, but somehow the fact that, arguably, the worlds finest singer shows a vulnerability adds to the performance especially when combined with her self deprecating honesty."
"Having seen Adele previously at the Hammersmith Apollo a few years ago we really wanted to get tickets again, my wife tried for many hours to get tickets for her last tour and when this 4 night tour went on sale she tried again we were successful getting tickets for the Wednesday night, the only problem was she had no choice but to buy the drinking package at £249 each but because we wanted to see her we had no choice but to buy them.  We had had an email form Songkick advising us to arrive early for security check which was understandable in the light of recent events, the line to enter was building up when we arrived at 4.30 pm, everyone was waiting for the 5pm opening, 5pm passed and everyone were patient but they did not start letting people in until around 5.20 pm.  Eventually we were let in to the Bobby Moore suite to start the evening with a drink, the food choice for the suite was very limited, sushi, salad or hot dog (which were not hot at all), we enjoyed a few glasses of wine before we entered the stadium.  Once we got to our seats for the start of the show is when we realised that if we wanted to see anything we should have taken binoculars even though we were only on the second tier to be honest Adele was a dot on the stage.  Adele performance was amazing and once again she meet our every expectations she has an brilliant voice and is so down to earth.  Paying that kind of money to see her show was worth it just to experience her voice and music, but paying that kind of money for the entry to the Bobbie Moore suite (which was just a function room) was really over priced.  We had a fantastic time listening to Adele but the before part was a total waste of money."
"Few artists have enjoyed the success over the course of a career spanning several decades that Adele has achieved over the past few years. Escaping the curse of that dreaded second album, ‘21’ propelled Adele into superstardom faster than anyone could have predicted and has broken probably every record that was there to be broken."
I was waiting ages and hoping Adele would announce a new tour since the 21 tour that i missed for being minutes slow for the tickets.
"First, I must say, that show was AMAZING!!!The black & white screen matches her music style perfectly, including the videos playing on."
"Our family of 4 daughters, my husband and myself saw Adele on 10/03/17, her first Sydney show. We have loved Adele since we listened to her first album in 2010. As soon as we heard she was coming we knew we had to be there. Even though we were seated  very far away from the stage Adele made everyone of the 950000 crowd feel like we were all much closer."
"I attended her concert in the biggest venue here in Oslo, Norway – Telenor Arena. It is perhaps mostly known for its lack of acoustic quality. The room is simply put way too big and sterile for that. Nevertheless; The Adele Tour team actually pulled it off this time though, and were able to fill the «dead» space in a more that satisfying manner."
"The show was a dream come true. Adele is beautiful, charming, kind, warm, and breathtaking. I sincerely can't say enough about her. Her voice was crisp and clear and 100x better than the studio version and I can't believe that's even possible. She created such a personable and intimate experience in an arena by interacting with the audience and carrying conversations with us. She'd stop nearly after every song to chat with us about the song, her thought process when writing it, her feelings and experiences when the song came out, etc. It was like being at a release party and I loved it! It was like she was an old friend who felt like home. She had two stages, one at the front and one in the back to be closer to those sitting far away. She had a large screen spanning across the front stage so that you could get good video feeds of her performance, which was refreshing as the last few concerts I've been to didn't consider the people sitting in the back. Seeing the artist perform live and listening to them live are all part of the concert experience and seeing them is a large enhancement. She even had her own rain room and her band was fantastic."
"I am not going to review the show, as this has been done by thousands of others."
"Not worth seeing in a large venue like Madison Square Garden. She's a huge star so it makes sense that she plays the amount of seats she can sell out for (gotta make them $$), but the music type and quality is just not suited to this kind of setting. Beacon Theater would be a great spot to watch her perform since she's not much of a performer beyond the superhuman voice. It's an intimate experience that's bastardized by having her sing in a voluminous atmosphere."
"I went to see Adele at the 1th of June 2016 in the Ziggodome in Amsterdam. I'm a big fan of her since day one. 19, 21 and now 25 and she is still getting better! I already bought tickets in december'15 so i waited for nearly 7 months until it finally took place. I red some reviews from her concert in London and they were all terrific, so now i was even more excited!"
"This review is dealing with concert entry.  I purchased my tickets and had to pick them up at the arena the night of the concert.  The doors were supposed to open at 6:00.  They did not open until 6:40.  We got into a very long line at 6:40.  People in line were very upset, because, after an hour, we were still not anywhere close to the arena to get in due to the length of the line."
"I thought the show was amazing. I got the tickets through the pre-sale. Even though I was quite disappointed in the seat selection I was able to get through the pre-sale when I logged into the site at the exact time the pre-sale started for her Monday night show in Chicago, they ended up being okay for nose-bleeds. We were right in front of her and her main screen. Adele has always been my favorite and a role model and as soon as she came out, I started crying and could not stop until a song and a half later. At the end of the day, I can say I was at least in the same room as her even though I was more than willing to pay a lot more money to see her/be closer to her. Lastly, I've never been to the United Center before, so that was neat. People have told me that their sound quality there isn't that good and I only experienced that when she talked in between her pieces. I wished they were able to get her a different mic or turn up the volume on it immensely because I was not able to hear in some parts as well as my mother. Nothing on her because she has such great talent, a voice, and is such a doll. I hope she tours again because I will definitely go!"
"The visual effects, stage management, Adele interaction and story telling was all brilliant....."
"The. Best. Night. Of. My. Entire. Life. This was the second time for me to see Adele. Last time I was quite high up, this time I was in Golden Circle. The atmosphere was incredible, Adele made me feel like I was the only one there in a packed out stadium. The banter she has with her audience in hilarious, she includes everyone and t feels like you're hanging out with your best mate you've known for years. As for her songs, the emotion and passion she sings with is just so raw and heart warming, I cried so many tears. You can tell she has an absolute ball on stage and she has so many upbeat songs and the sass she has is unreal- it cracks me up every time! I feel so grateful to have been apart of this tour and so happy that Adele decided to share this experience with every single one of us. I hope she has the most relaxing break with her family and hope she knows we'll always be here for her whenever/ if she decides to come back. Xx"
Adele was freaking amazing Big love 4 her.
"Sus ojos se abrieron con la mayor puntualidad contemplada jamás en el Palau Sant Jordi, al menos, visto por un servidor."

Rihanna,"Rihanna made her entrance through one of the tunnels like a boxer coming out for the main event. Concealing her face under a heavy hood, she slowly found her way onto the platform opposite the stage. A spotlight followed her every move, making the white robe glow, while phone lights provided stars to pierce through the dark night surrounding her. A single microphone waited on a stand as thunderous applause and ear-piercing screams filled the venue, and it served to silence the crowd in an instant. “All along it was a fever, a cold sweat hot-headed believer…” Having exposed nothing more than her unmistakable voice (and fingernails and unmistakable ass) to her audience, there was no doubt as to who was hiding under that robe. The entirety of “Stay” was performed from that position, before she revealed her face. Having attended close to a thousand concerts, it’s not often I find myself in awe at being in close proximity to a musician, but seeing Rihanna standing in front of me, in the flesh, made me realize what a cult of personality she has built around herself. As she continued the performance with “Love the Way You Lie (Part II)”, she was part pop diva, part rock star, part sex symbol, all while never being anything but Rihanna. She is still so young, yet has already solidified herself among the very few people in history who everyone will know by a single name. It was very in the show, but I was already convinced she had earned that status as well. Her voice is her defining talent, but her business acumen, stage presence, attitude, and beauty are what complete the package. - See more at: http://ilistensoyoudonthaveto.com/2016/05/10/rihanna-viejas-arena-05-09-16/#sthash.AluW51yF.dpuf ",pos
Rihanna,"It was said that the entrance was at 5 p.m., but we were only in the stadium at around 7 p.m. and the music was already playing. Outside everyone was getting nervous. Only when we got to the front did we read on a poster that The Weekend was not going to come at all. It's a shame that there was no information about it on the INTERNET! We were all in line, around 4 p.m. And we had to watch each other the whole time as crowds of people just walk past us and push their way forward. And none of the security staff did anything about it. We have received e-mails saying that there will be stricter controls and that we should therefore plan more time, but where were the staff for this and to be honest it was a very poor control and still it took forever! When we finally got inside we didn't even know where to go because there was simply nothing signposted. Big Sean was really in the mood. He was there for an hour. After that there was only one playlist and we waited over an hour for Rihanna. When she finally came, the back and foot pain were forgotten from all standing and waiting. She gave us one great show offered. I love her and the comments on the internet that she was listless is just not true. The show only lasted 90 minutes and we would have all been happy about an encore, but it was still a great concert!",neu
Rihanna,"With all that has happened in France recently, Rihanna faced a stiff challenge getting Parisians and herself in a summery party mood at the Stadt De France. However, she seemed to instinctively make the right choices to tap into the crowds fears, their need to reflect and their right to sing and dance without care. Rihanna opened the show hidden beneath a white hooded sweater and sang the wistful 'Stay' - a song whose lyrics took on a lot of ambivalence given the current political climate. The songs from her Anti album were well received even though their lazy, sexy groove is more suited to a more intimate arena. Among the many hits from the album, 'Desperado' and 'Kiss it Better' stood out as they showcased Rihanna's scything vocals and Prince-like funk. Rihanna also expertly mixed in medleys of favourites such as 'Umbrella', 'Man Down' and 'We Found Love in a Hopeless Place.' An undoubted highlight was 'Diamonds' which was introduced with a genuinely heartfelt speech by Rihanna expressing support for peace and the people of France. She then asked for the stadium to send out its light to France by way of illuminated mobile phones and the result was a spectacular touching moment. By the end of the show, everyone had fallen more in love with Rihanna and headed back into the dark Parisian night with a little more light in their hearts and minds. ",pos
Rihanna,"You've seen her music videos. You follow her on twitter. You follow her style, trends, favorites. You sing the lyrics in the shower, driving home with your friends, serenading a lover. But nothing is as real as seeing Rihanna perform live!!!  The energy from the audience, the attitude and power that's thrown back off the stage...ah-maz-ing.   The peeks and valleys from the soulful serenade of Stay to the sexy shock of S&M it's all new once you hear it live!  One of my favorite things about going to a show is not only the excitement building up to it, buying the tickets then getting my bracelet and going in. That's just the beginning. I love more than anything, after seeing a great show and I'm back at home listening to the music, remembering where I was, who I was with, how I felt, what I saw and how much fun we were having when we were rocking out and suddenly, Rihanna isn't just some celebrity entertainer, she is a part of something bigger and the music is suddenly different, better, more meaningful.   I've seen Rihanna a couple of times and every time that girl delivers. Her fans love her, she has attitude and swag that makes her real and sometimes the energy leaves you glowing for days and asking yourself, how long do I have to wait until music makes me feel this high again? ",pos
Rihanna,"It was a great concert from the begining. DJ Mustard started the show, and it was wery good warm up, people were dancing. Then after a little break came on the stage Big Sean. That was also powerful performance and we really enjoyed that. After another break started Rihanna's show. She came from the back of the arena to the little stage above the soundmen. Two slow songs were awesome. Than she walked on steel and glass bridge and sing a song Woo and another one above us. See was so close to us, that was perfect. Then the reast of the show was on the main stage. She sings wery well, but the sound was overbassed, and the singing can't be heared clearly, that was mistake. Also she was'n talk much, she gave us one song after another. But the songs are so great. It was generally songs from the new album Anti, great. The show duration was 90min. I'm so blessed that I was on the show. I was great. Thank you and hopefully see you RiRi again soon. ",pos
Rihanna,"Rihanna's Anti World tour concert in Malmö was even better than I expected. I have to be honest, I was not a big fan of hers but of course Queen Riri changed that with her beautiful yet slaying personality and amazing voice. The overall experience was fun althought the only thing that was a littlee annoying is the fact that the concert started a little more than an hour later than what it was supposed to. But I mean.. it's Rihanna, she can do whatever. A tips from me would be to either buy the standing tickets as close to the scene as possible or buy the ones that are high up and on the opposite side of the scene. I was up and although it was long away from Riri it was magical to see all the people and the lights and literary everything. If you're hesirating weather you should go or not I would tell you to go go go, because it is such a beautiful and fun experience to have! ",pos
Rihanna,"In one word - unforgettable. Rihanna was in rare form. This tour has a more subdued palette than her other tours, as the stage was a blank white, and all of her outfits were in shades of cream, tan, black, and brown. However, there was a special energy in the room that night. Rihanna seemed happy, comfortable, and more in control than she has ever been. She joked with the crowd, engaged with all sides of the arena, and made sure everyone had a good time. Halfway during the concert, she announced that it was party time, and the stage lit up with these cool colored pods that pulsated in different colors. Other highlights include her flying over the audience, a foam machine on stage, and her dancers exciting the crowd in sparkly outfits. I envy those who are going to see her, and implore those who can still buy tickets to do so! ",pos
Rihanna,"Rihanna is probably one of the best pop artists at the moment. I've gone to three shows - first in Portugal, in her ""Loud"" tour; 2nd in London in a small venue for her ""777"" tour; and the last one in Richmond park, as part of the ""Unapolagetic"" tour.    All of them were incredibly amazing! Her songs put so much energy in the crowd and it's impossible to not get stuck to her dance moves and stage special effects. From the lights, sceneries, to the outfits - everything is top quality and very sophisticated and original. You are able to listen to the top hits, and also some medleys from her older stuff. Setlists are wisely chosen, as they keep the crowd excited along the show. I would definitely go to her next show - it's always a surprise and somewhat different from what she has done until now. She rocks! ",pos
Rihanna,"Daaaammmn. I didn't know what to expect, especially since I found myself more excited for the preshow of 'the weeknd'to the Rhianna tour and contemplated selling the tickets after he and Travis Scott pulled out. I'm glad I didn't. The show itself made me realise just how many anthems Rhianna has to her name.These sprinkled throwbacks were the most memorable for me throughout the show. The set and lighting combined to give a fab production value over all, in particular the very beginning where Rihanna emerged from behind and took a smaller stage before flying off on a clear platform across to the main stage. Overall I really really enjoyed the show. Wasn't quite one that made me jump and wave my arms around, but one that made me appreciate the talent Rihanna clearly has. ",neu
Rihanna,"Grate show! Would definitely go see Rihanna live again! Enjoyed everything - signing, visuals, dancing, costumes! Really recommend to watch Rihanna live performance at least once! A bit long show due to 2 artists performing before Rihanna and also a bit too long time waiting for her to get on the stage. Not nice, especially for people standing all that super long time in VIP zone and Golden Circle without possibility to leave in between and not loose their position closer to stage. Can imagine it was very tough to stand more than three hours in a raw. Had standing ticket myself and must say it was a bit hard. Other than that - the Rihanna's performance was worth every bit of waiting! Loved her! ",neu
Rihanna,"An amazing experience as one would expect but even though I'm a huge Rihanna's fan you could tell that she became too ""big"" so I didn't feel that connection with the fans even though she was waving to everyone but it didn't feel genuine. At one direction concert for example I felt more interaction from one of the members Liam even though my sister is a bigger fan then I am. I feel like I was born too late lol she's a goddess but the concerts are not like they were in the 80's  or 90's. Overall she proved to me talented and more beautiful than on TV but I will remember her and not the concert so much. ",neg
Rihanna,"Incredibly powerful show, red hot, amazing dancers and acrobats, spectacular costumes, fantastic sound and light but most of all flawless vocals by Rihanna and her backing singers, loved the song choices and have been hooked on the Anti album ever since!! Finally the show was a visual sensation, what the whole theme seemingly inspired by dessert troopers / safari chic explorers / inter galactic space oddity head pieces and hoods plus a whole load of shimmer and sequins! ",pos
Rihanna,It was a great fucking show I loved it so much. She is my second favorite female singer second only to Lana Del Rey. Her energy and presence and love for buffalo was present and everyone in the crowd felt it. The only negatives I can think of is that she only sung tidbits of a few songs which made the concert much shorter than necessary also there were remixes on her classics when she should have just stuck with the original beat. 4.5/5 for me. ,pos
Rihanna,"Too short, I think people pay a lot of money just for see her and she was late, 20:50 (supposly 20:30) she left at 22:20 (ten minutes before the hour) she spend too much time in the backstage changing her clothes and she didn't finish any song, just Diamond. So I had fun, I sang a lot but is definitely not what we were expecting, bit dissapointed. The staff was really nice. Sorry for my english, I'm not british. ",neg
Rihanna,"Now, I'm not a massive Rihanna fan, but I went because it was my friends birthday. She was lip syncing most of it, and half the time she was changing cloths, allowing her backing singers to fill in  the rest of it. I would expect someone of her popularity to give her fans, her legit voice. I can only really see Diamonds as the one time she sang properly, so that was a genuine stand out. ",neg
Rihanna,"Amazing. So many throwbacks. I really liked the Anti album, but I was also glad that she performed her line in songs like ""Take Care"" ""Run This Town"" ""Love the Way You Lie"", & she did throwbacks like ""Man Down"", ""Umbrella"", and even songs that weren't on her album like ""FourFive Seconds"". Performance is amazing, and her stage presence was ethereal. 10/10 would recommend. ",pos
Rihanna,"Love Rihanna and it was great seeing her, however, the Anti World Tour is really mellow/moody and not so much exciting/mind-blowing. The show seemed really fast and it probably didn't help my experience that the girl next to me was hammered and falling into me every minute. Overall, it could've been watched on youtube for a better experience. ",neg
Rihanna,Hands down one of the best concerts I've been to in a very long time. She interacted with her fans. She entered from the back so all her fans that were far from the stage got to see her up close. She even brought out surprise guest Drake and he did a couple songs. Truly amazing night. Great show I would definitely see Rihanna again ,pos
Rihanna,"Oh na na, that's her name!   I have been to see Rihanna live many times and each time I have been pleasantly suprised. She compeltely owns the stage and puts on an amazing show!  She spends time with the crowd, interacting and does a well rehearsed show of all her greatest hits. Highly recommended! ",pos
Rihanna,"Hello Beautiful Queen Rihanna, when are coming back to Detroit, Michigan for a concert and turn it out? You are a great performer and a fabulous singer. I love your style. Can't wait to see you. Love all of your music. Continue your Legacy. Hope to  see you soon my Queen. ",neu
Coldplay,"I had always heard Coldplay were a fantastic band to see live. They did not disappoint last night at Fedex Field, right in the midst of their joyous and decidedly over-the-top Head Full of Dreams tour. The show began with an explosion of color and light (including the LED wristbands supplied to every concertgoer) in the titular track on the band's touring album. Then came fan-favorite ""Yellow,"" followed by ""Every Teardrop is a Waterfall,"" the ever-popular ""The Scientist,"" and ""Birds"" (the latter was a bit of a personal disappointment as it replaced the brilliant ""God Put a Smile Upon Your Face"" from recent setlists). This part of the show finished with the anthem ""Paradise,"" featuring an incredible remix outro. Next the show slowed down for an intimate trio of songs (most of us actually took a seat). This included one of the better tracks from the sub-par ""Ghost Stories"", ""Magic."" Soon, however, things picked up with the timeless piano strokes of ""Clocks,"" themed to a magical red light show. Next came the lighthearted ""Charlie Brown."" Before it began, lead singer Chris Martin asked everyone to put away their phones and simply enjoy the show. This was followed by the radio hit ""Hymn for the Weekend,"" a candlelit (okay...Iphone flashlight lit) ""Fix You,"" and ""Viva la Vida."" This last one was remarkable, as nearly the entire stadium knew the lyrics and sang along to the triumphant ""Oh-oh-ohhhh"" chant. The groovy ""Adventure of a Lifetime"" finished off this section, featuring Chris gettin' down with the audience, asking everyone to ""Get low!"" Then came the highlight of the night for me: an acoustic quad of older (*cough* better *cough*) Coldplay songs which were as intimate as they were nostalgic. The lovely riffs of ""In my Place"" started off the set. ""Don't Panic"" was sung by drummer Will Champion; it's one of my favorites. But it couldn't top what was (for me) the best song of the night: ""Trouble."" Somber but beautiful in its own way, ""Trouble"" is a rare find in the setlists of today's Coldplay and was absolutely fantastic. Finally came another rare gem: ""Green Eyes,"" which was somewhat marred by Chris's well-intentioned attempt at giving the local Redskins some luck (HA! what folly) by changing the lyrics. The finale of the show was the hopeful and popular trio of ""Something Just like This,"" ""A Sky Full of Stars,"" and ""Up and Up."" This last track was played against the backdrop of the magical and visually stunning music video for the song. And if there were two adjectives to sum up the show as a whole, they would be just that: magical and visually stunning. Thanks for an awesome show, Coldplay! ",pos
Coldplay,"If you're wondering what to expect from Coldplay, expect the best show of your life!  This was my first time seeing Coldplay at the Royal Albert Hall in London and I have to say this was one of best nights of my life. No exaggeration. They performed many of their most popular classics such as ""Fix you"" and ""The Scientist"" and pretty much all of my favourites ""Charlie Brown"" and ""Every Teardrop is a Waterfall"" including new tracks from their latest album, Ghost Stories.   The atmosphere was incredible; I've never experienced anything like it in comparison. You just had to be there! Coldplay had you dancing out of your seats for their upbeat tracks such as ""Sky Full Of Stars"" and hearing their more mellow tracks like ""True Love"" was just simply beautiful and enchanting. Their playlist for the night was definitely on point and well connected with the crowd and us fans. The stage was right in the center so I'm pretty sure everyone had a great view, it was all set up very well and the lighting looked brilliant.  And as for my most memorable experience? The whole gig! There was a point at the end of ""God Put a Smile Upon Your Face"" when Chris Martin literally threw his electric guitar in the air and let it smash the floor for an epic finish, everyone went crazy!!! Coldplay has been a strong British iconic band for many years now, they know how to put on a show and they honestly do give it their all.   Me and my friend are proud to say that we was there that night, last thing I have to say is that if you ever get the chance to see Coldplay live, grab your tickets and grab them quick!   I promise you, you won't be disappointed in the slightest.  Prepare to be blown away! ",pos
Coldplay,"This was my second time seeing Coldplay, and both times were amazing. The song choice was great, with a mix of classic hits (""Yellow"", ""The Scientist"", ""Viva la Vida"", ""Paradise""( old favourites (""Til Kingdom Come"", and ""Shiver"" being played upon request), and newer, more high energy songs off ""A Head Full of Dreams"". The Xylobands were a hit again, really making a spectacular light show along with various other effects, and colourful balloons being released into the crowd. The whole audience was just so full of energy thanks to the band's performance. Since it was raining heavily, the roof had to be covered, which meant no fireworks, but the band still delivered an amazing show despite this. Frontman Chris Martin always creates a great atmosphere, with enthusiasm and positivity, like carrying the country's flag in his back pocket, and apologising for the fact that, as he put it, ""Britain did something pretty stupid last week..."" and just generally making the crowd feel great with humour and honesty. All of the band members just look really comfortable with each other and deliver a really great performance together. Tributes were very nicely and elegantly paid to Muhammad Ali and David Bowie, and the final song, ""Up & Up"", ended the concert on a really positive note, and I would definitely recommend Coldplay to anyone who has the chance to see them play live. ",pos
Coldplay,"There is little in this world that compares to a Coldplay concert. Exhilarating, energetic and euphoric are just some of the words that can be used to describe what one experiences when Chris Martin and band take to the stage. One of my most memorable concert experiences ever, when Coldplay played the Emirates Stadium back in 2012, it was simply astounding. Extravagant production and simply phenomenal live music, it became clear to me why tickets for these shows trade hands for thousands and why fans travel far and wide. Hearing 60,000 people sing word for word hit singles such as Paradise, Fix You and Princess of China made the hairs on my arms stand on end, so one can only imagine how this must feel for the band. Their track record speaks for itself. Eight Brit Awards, seven Grammys, six number one albums and 60 million record sales make Coldplay’s success undeniable and they continue to reign as one of the world’s biggest bands. The reason behind this success becomes clear at a live show. As a live act, Coldplay have achieved things that others have not. They are truly in a league of their own and this can only be understood when you witness this for yourself. I have tried but my words simply cannot capture the magic. ",pos
Coldplay,"First of all I need to just say wow! Wow! Yesterday I experienced one of the greatest nights of my life. Yesterday I really did feel like I was part of something special, something so big and beautiful. The love, the happiness and the excaitment people were feeling last night were something you can't put words on.  We stood in the rain for so many hours, we sat in a que and then we stood in the rain again.. but let me just say that when Coldplay came on stage they put on the best god damn show ever. You could really feel their thankfulness during the show. They promised us (in Chris Martins own words) ""The best fucking show ever"" and let me tell you it was! During the night I got to experience people from different countries dancing and singing along together, I got to experience that moment when Chris decided to write a new song about Sweden and Gothenburg! The night was amazing in so many ways. And just as he said during the night, that he believes when people are working together and last night everybody in that arena stood together. We celebrated the music, the evening and most of all we celebrated the love. Because in the end of the day Love is what matters and it will always win. Yesterday was beautiful, just pure beautiful! ",pos
Coldplay,"Since the release of Coldplay's fifth album 'Mylo Xyloto' the emphasis of their live show appears to be on the theatrics and the avant-garde. An album so super charged with power pop it was considered a substitute to red bull, the band quickly substituted the tender subtleties of 'Shivers' for the brass tones of 'Charlie Brown' and 'Hurts Like Heaven'. These new tracks are undoubtedly anthemic yet the visual displays and complexing stage layouts slightly detract from the musicianship of the quartet. Whilst performing the more downtempo and emotive tracks from break up album 'Ghost Stories' Chris Martin's vocal sounds notably weak during 'Magic' and all of the pyro-techniques and visuals cannot hide this. They recover with some classics including 'The Scientist' which is sang back in force by the crowds and the flawless 'Every Teardrop is A Waterfall' closes the main set in a suitably euphoric manner. However the choice to return with the floundering and flat 'anthem' 'Sky Full of Stars' which Chris consistently fails to deliver vocally seems a poor way to close a tour from one of the world's most esteemed pop/rock bands. It leaves the audiences wondering if 'Mylo Xyloto' was a particular career pinnacle for the band. ",neu
Coldplay,"A Coldplay concert is a real face to face experience for a someone who love their songs. It may not be an intimate experience but considering the legions of fans that they have only a concert can accommodate everyone who are waiting all their lives for a chance to hear them live. and they never disappoint. A total performance complete with lasers and light and firework BUT without much fanfare, just them singing & playing their hearts OUT song after song alone or in harmony with the fans some crying, most gleefully dancing to their upbeat song or swaying OR slow dancing to slow Fix You or Yellow and probably thinking of someone they ""cannot replace"". Chris Martin is an awesome guy and so are the rest of the band. May their personal lives be as awesome as their professional lives, they deserve that too. as to Singapore, it may not be as engaging as it would be in the Philippines but hey, no one can complain; i had the best time celebrating my birthday in one of the best stadium this side of town with around 50K Coldpay fans celebrating with me :) :). Long live Coldplay, may you continue to bring joy to you fans worldwide. Looking forward to another Coldplay concert experience in the future. lsM/cebu/ ",pos
Coldplay,"Most AMAZING show I've EVER seen. I've seen some legends. The Who, BB King, Depeche Mode five times, the Cute, Social Distortion, Blue October, many, many more. Coldplay blew them ALL away by far, and I even had crappy seats. I see them again in Philly in August, and I'm counting down the days! Fireworks! The bracelets lit up and changed colors with the stage lighting. Michael J Fox made a special guest appearance playing ""Earth Angel"" and ""Johnny B Good"" with the band. He was spectacular!! The show lasted just over two hours, but it felt like it had just started. Chris Martin may very well be the greatest front man of all time. He can work a crowd, even the stuffed shirts, like nobody's business. Coldplay is my favorite band for a reason, only a few of them listed above. They're all classically trained musicians. All of them multi-instrumentalists. Songs range from ballads to get up on your feet and jump around beats! AMAZING show, AMAZING band! I love you Guy, Jonny, Will, and Chris. Please keep doing what you're doing. ",pos
Coldplay,"Piece of para paraa paradise in Berlin!!! It was one of the best shows in my life (if it comes to visual effects), all of these confetti, colourful  powders in the air, and big baloons! One big WOW.  Chris and his band were so joyful, funny and relaxed. I always thought he has a nice voice, nothing spectacular, just ""quite normal voice"". That's my opinion. And after the show I'm not going to change that. Instruments were great, his voice was cool, that's it. But songs were just awesome, I loved that! Especially the older ones like Paradise, The Scientist, Princess of China (ft. Rihanna, I was sooo happy to hear that song!), Fix you, etc. Of course there were many occasions to dance when you heard Hymn for The Weekend (AMAZING, with additional techno(?)dance remixes), Adventure of a lifetime, viva la vida or sky full of stars. My rate from 1 to 5 is 4+. Great atmosphere, great people, I had fun and I definitely want to see Coldplay again! :) ",pos
Coldplay,"Coldplay. What can I say? They are masters of the stadium experience. The fireworks and the LED wrist bands that lit up the stadium and made you feel part of the show, not just watching it.The lightshow, the lasers, the ambiance. We didn't have the best spot to see the whole thing, but enough room to dance and see them when the got onto the runway- to enjoy the star/ leaf confetti the trade off  for not being able to see the whole thing in from afar- so the highlight for me was when they came OFF the stage, passed  by where I was standing on a path cut out by security guards and then sang Kingdom Come, only feet away- a song I used to play on my guitar and my son plays- who is presently in NYC- and THAT was my highlight. A beautiful song without all the flashing lights, a song close to me and my family. They are humble and they are fabulous musicians. They can make you laugh and sing and dance and cry.Keep on doing what you do.Please. ",pos
Coldplay,"This was indeed, one of the best concerts I've ever been to. Opened by Ximena Sariñana and later on by Lianne La Havas (who I didn't previously know, but has an incredible voice btw), the concert started on time, and with a completely full venue. Coldplay has an amazing production, Chris Martin spoke in spanish several times and the people loved the band. The were baloons, fireworks, confetti, colored powder, and these bracelets that were given to everybody that turned on and off in different colors in sync with the music. Almost through the end, Christ Martin announced that they were recording a video for A Head Full of Dreams so they were playing again that song. Everybody went crazy. The setlist was great, balancing all the well-known songs from the band with the new songs from their latest album. I enjoyed the concert a lot a hope the visit Mexico again soon. ",pos
Coldplay,"Great show with Coldplay .... when they finally came up on stage! The show should start at 19:00 - and it should include 2 guest appearances... that guest appearances turned up to be opening-acts! two completely worthless acts that started after 19:00 AND played 30min each + 30 min in between + then at least 30min to rig the stage before Coldplay went on just after 21:00. SUCH A DRAG! so Coldplay really had an up-hill start to overcome. why does it have to take so long time to change between a support act and the band everyone actually come to see?why can´t they fix the scene from the beginning??? I hate support-acts! and it should be clearly communicated BEFORE you buy tickets, if there is support-acts. ",neg
Coldplay,"Absolutely extraordinary and amazing show! This why is my nine-year-old son's first concert and he left saying that it was one of the best days of his life! It was magical! The billions pieces of confetti, fire and fireworks, as well as the enormous TV screens with fantastic videos. The production was truly incredible! Chris Martin and the whole Coldplay group went out of their way to make sure that everybody in the audience could see them. We had Fields seeds but the group performed in three different spots throughout the concert. I will never forget this concert. And what an amazing experience for my son as his first concert! Absolutely worth every penny! Thank You Coldplay for an extraordinary experience! ",pos
Coldplay,"Excellent show, acoustics and energy. It's Coldplay, so you expect good music. Even then it is awesome that thousands of Germans know every song and sing along. Chris Martin, in particular, is a good showman and truly knows how to get the audience involved. This is, obviously, apart from the prodigious talent he is, as a singer and song writer. As a friend decided to point of out that she ""lost some respect"" because they used minus tracks in the show and she expects better from Coldplay. I say, millions disagree and enjoy the ""show"" and the ""songs"" anyway! If you get a chance, just go to watch these guys... Naysayers and holier than thou music critics are always around with one comment or another! ",pos
Coldplay,"Colplay Brisbane 6th December 2016@ Suncorp Stadium These guys are the brightest, most humble and brilliant entertainers, we are lucky to havea band like Colplay. They delivered a fun filled interactive show with their confetti cannons, giant balloons that floated throughout the crowd. People all behaved and looked after each other in the muggy conditions,handing out water to those who needed it. Their stage and screen lit up bright like Christmas trees and everyone's wrist bands lit up to their music and created a more connected experience for all. I definitely recommend you catch Coldplay for they will remain in my heart and music memories for years to come. ",pos
Coldplay,"WOW! Amazing! Felt so privileged to be there. I have seen Coldplay many times. This was by far one of the best gigs we have been to given the size of the venue and our close proximity to the band. It felt so intimate and the band were clearly on a high from winning their award.  As always, they were so grateful for the support of their fans and gave a great performance. Euphoria ensued as the band belted out some of their best tracks. Just brilliant! I would happily go back in time and watch it over, and over, and over again! Can't wait to see them next week at the WarChild gig at the O2, then again in June at Wembley and Glasto...thank you Coldplay for being awesome! ",pos
Coldplay,"Dear Songkick, Coldplay's concert was a blast, thank you for asking! :) You mentioned that our reviews would help other songkickers decide whether it's worth seeing Coldplay live and my answer is hell yes! The experience was fantastic, the lights were amazing and the band really knows how to include their fans into the show. I've loved their music for quite some time and being a part of such an incredible adventure was the highlight of the past few years. Chris has the most amazing and reassuring voice and he sings just as awesome live as he does recorded. It was a beautiful evening and I'm very greatful to be a part of Coldplay's tour 2016. :) ",pos
Coldplay,"Head Full of Dreams in the Singapore National Stadium is the best concert we've ever seen -- BAR NONE! We stood up at the VIP standing pen for almost 4 hours including the front act. Jess Kent was also amazing so we didn't mind the initial wait. Afterwards the magic of the main act stage slowly unfolded. We didn't realize we will not only be given an aural treat, but also visual and interactive plays during the concert. Awesome music, performance and a magical audience was all that we needed to sustain our energy for the night -- no matter all the sweat, pushing and shoving we took on as part of it. Coldplay simply ROCKS! ",pos
Coldplay,"An amazing and almost epic experience. It was my fouth concert, but the first two was at festivals with a much smaller scale light show. The invention of giving the audience light wristbands has a dramatic effect, especially when it is almost dark, and is combined with changing colours and fireworks. Coldplay always sounds like they are enjoying playing live and enjoying each other. That brings a very special atmosphere to the show, and makes you feel important. The list of brilliant songs are long, and you have to dance and sing along. In short - don't miss a Coldplay concert if you have never been there. ",pos
Coldplay,"Really fun and entertaining concert despite the rain and being Sunday night!!! The set list was already available from previous tour dates but I enjoyed all the dancing, fireworks, colors and lights at the show. I saw them last in 2006 in Dublin. They have grown since and have more money off course but despite the scripted/lock&stock show settings still one band one enjoy to see live in big venues and to which you can bring your family and friends They did songs from most of their albums which I found quite nice. Really an enjoyable show Martin even managed to get the Swiss crowd dancing, kudos to him ;) ",pos
Drake,"Drake's energy on the stage is just incomparable to anybody I've seen. The way he connects with the crowd is unbelievable. I think that his energy on stage just get the crowd more hyped up so it's an all around good show whenever Drake performs.    From ""So Far Gone"" to ""Nothing Was The Same,"" his style and the way he gets his message across have stayed the same. That's the best thing about aging, you get better as time progresses and I think that his albums are a definite reminder of how lyrically and musically talented he is. Many artist make one or two good albums, maybe a song or two every now and then, but Drake has consistently been at the top releasing good music and is just on fire. It's easier to get to the top than to stay there, but he's proving to everyone that he has enough to get to the top and knock anyone down who try's to take him down. I love how he makes his music to fit any type of mood that you're feeling. His music isn't just slow R&B, he has some up-tempo music that will get you feeling pumped up and ready to go. I also love how he isn't like a Lil Wayne type of rapper who just uses auto tune and throws random gun verses in his songs. Every song is well thought out, every line is placed just right, the words flow with the beat and it's just magic. Even if you don't like Drake, when ""Hold on, We're Going Home"" comes on you're going to start singing. His songs are just too catchy, and are just classic, so 30 years from now people will still be blasting ""Take Care"" in their car.    From what I've watched, he gives the people their moneys worth and leaves them waiting to see Drakes next move or when he's dropping his next album. He's just an all around great artist and performer, strongly recommend seeing him. ",pos
Drake,"I have never been a huge fan of Drake, but after becoming hooked on the 2013 song ‘Hold on we’re going home’, I decided to check out his back catalogue of work, and was really surprised with what I found, and immediately regretted discounting him previously. The combination of chilled out tracks in contrast with his rapping and songs like ‘Headlines’ provides such great listening variation, covering a variety of musical genres. Drake’s recent performance at this years Grammys was simply breath-taking, drawing in the audience to the narrative of ‘Hold on we’re going home’ without being showy or over the top, yet managing to merge smoothly into the track ‘Started from the Bottom’, providing the audience with a more upbeat track. Drake’s interaction with his audience, especially on this occasion is something which he deserves credit for, maintaining his vocal performance whilst attempting to greet as many fans as possible. For me, this injection of his personality really provides the fans with a motivation to watch him live, as the dedication to both performance and fans is something that he appears to have mastered. He really is one of those artists that you have to see live to experience the full potential of his music. ",pos
Drake,I bought my tickets to Lil Wayne VS. Drake about 4 months ago and finally got to attend the show on Saturday. Wow. My mind was blown. First of all G-Easy Opened for them and really got the crowd warmed up for the headliners. The whole show was like a video game with Drake and Lil Wayne going back and forth with old and new hits which I was so impressed with how they really mixed it up. Drake flew above the crowd suspended holding on to a stripper pole looking stand which Lil Wayne later dogged on him for. They battled back and forth about being the most featured artist and at the end I had chills because they were both saying how grateful they were for keeping each other's music alive. It was inspiring and poetic. I was impressed it was definitely the best show I have been to this year! ,pos
Drake,"Drake puts on a great show, honestly a great performer who is very talented. However, if you’re really going to tour with migos, and they don’t show up to do their opening set, there really should be some kind of refund. I came to the show expecting to see migos and then drake and then when migos didn’t show up I went into Drakes set disappointed about missing migos. Sure two of them came out and did 2 songs but really not enough. Instead of touring with these unreliable guys, tour by yourself, I would have no problem paying exactly what I paid for just Drake. ",neu
Drake,"Tickets were very expensive. This was one of the most I have ever paid for a concert ticket, need to make it affordable for his fans. His stage presence was brilliant and loved how much he relates himself to the UK and a personal bond with Birmingham. He did lots of his lesser successful songs which was disappointing, songs like crew love which lots of his fans LOVE came on for 10 seconds then he switched into another one. Just felt it lacked real good performances of his better known and his best songs. ",neu
Drake,"I really liked the show! Drake was an amazing entertainer and made me feel seen and made the show worthwhile. He really suprised me in a positive way:) I loved the sequals were he talked between the songs and the drirecting of scenery was incredible. Some of the most impressive stuff I have ever seen on a stage. He was a good singer, and I liked his tribute to Rihanna. Thanks Drake, for an awesome experience. You are way coolet than I thought ",pos
Drake,One of the best concerts I've been to in a while...   Then opening act: party next door wasn't very well known  But when the main acts got on stage the party was really bumpin.   Great set list. I can say that I was standing and dancing the whole night and rapping along. They had an interactive portion to help decide who won the rap battle between Drake and Lil Wayne through a downloaded app on your phone. Overall awesome experience! ,pos
Drake,"Amazing preformance! He's very enganging and interactive with the crowed, not to mention insanely talented! There was a really cool moving light show (globes of lights that were lowered and raised to create patterns above the audiance as well as change colors). Would have loved to hear more from some of his first albums but all in all a fantastic show. Definatly was worth spending the extra money for floor seats :) ",pos
Drake,The Drake vs Lil wayne show was definantly a must see! The whole competitive feel of them trying to one up eachother really drove the energy up! Drake is amazing live but honestly Lil Wayne stole the show for me. Also the production value is through the roof! It's less of a concert and more of an experience! They played all of their hits as well as their old stuff! Definantly get a seat to this one! ,pos
Drake,Drake was unbelievable on a whole his chats in between the songs conveyed important messages and overall he was just so unbelievable to see live I would 100% recommend. He even took someones Odell Beckham Jr Jersey from them when walking to the stage and got it signed by Odell Beckham Jr and then gave it back to him. Inspiration and truly amazing man. ,pos
Drake,The show was soo good. The firsts parts were too long but when Drake arrived the stage was on fire and everybody was singing all his songs. He said also a lot of beautiful things about how the world is today and this was so emotional. I really want to go again to his concert if he'll come in a few years.That was a fucking good experience damn it! ,pos
Drake,"I was so annoyed that he rescheduled the show and then on top of that, he didn't come on stage until close to 10pm. But he made up for it with a great show and he brought out Trey Songz, Giggs, Skepta, Popcaan and Nicki Minaj. Incredible atmosphere, great performance, and just a brilliant show in all. Drizzy showed a lot of love for London! ",pos
Drake,My first real concert and I am not disappointed at all. He is such a great artist and it was literally one of the best nights of my life. There's no difference when he sings on stage to on the songs that are recorded. I can't explain how happy I was and I had such a great time. I can't wait for him to come back one more time as he said. #6god ,pos
Drake,"Amazing!!!! Way above any expectations I had of the show! Not only was the music great and Drake's voice even greater (live!!), him as an entertainer was really impressive. The way he interacted with the audience and spoke to ALL of us was so enjoyable. I'd recommend for anyone considering to buy tickets to his shows to DO IT. ",pos
Drake,Great setlist. A good balance whithin his repertoire. He played some hits for the girls and others for the boys but in general the setlist was built to turn up the audience. Visually it was interesting. Quite impressing. Glad to see that he brought some real musicians with him (drummer and keyboards player) besides his DJ. ,pos
Drake,"The show was amazing and was definitely worth every cent! Drake and Migos put on a great show, however there was a long wait. We had to wait almost two hours after the time the concert was supposed to start, but I mean the show made up for it and Drake went past the time it was supposed to end and gave us our moneys worth. ",neu
Drake,I was really excited before the concert. Drake delayed the concert by a month promising a spectacular production. I hate that it was on Monday but the production was indeed spectacular. Drake was late by 40 minutes but he also ended up playing 40 more minutes. Next time though he could talk less and start the mosh sooner. ,neu
Drake,"I love Drake's concerts, the energy and the performance he brings on stage is amazing. No wonder he is one of the best rappers we have. I always get t-shirts with his lyrics and get so many compliments at his concerts. If you guys want to get his typographical lyrics printed on a shirt go to albumapparel.com/ ",pos
Drake,"I attended the show on a Saturday night and wasn't expecting much from the 6 God except for good bars. How wrong was I... The set was amazing,  and he interacted with the crowd really well. I've been to Adele,  micheal Jackson and even Bowie,  but this was by far the best show i have ever been to. ",pos
Drake,Awesome concert! The guy is a MF performer! He honored the bay area rap history by bringing a lot if the local ethos of the culture. Drake himself was amazing and really dedicated to his crowd that responded accordingly to his generosity during the show. Very relaxes and authentic Drake. ,pos
Eminem,"“EMINEM.”    Seeing his name lit across the stage was mind blowing. As if natural instinct, everyone started chanting, ‘EM-IN-EM, EM-IN-EM’, until the legend himself took the stage, wearing a get up that only the King of Rap could pull off. Without a breathe of a moment, he jumps directly in to rapping, setting the crowd on fire as most of us have been waiting in the stadium for hours, and some of us have been waiting for years. As far back as we can remember, Eminem was there, withstanding the wrath of time and still being able to top the charts many, many years later. The audience was as real as he is, old, young (too young), male, female and people of all colours were there. I could see it in their eyes, as they threw their hands to the beat and mouthed every word along with him, that at this moment, this is all they have ever wanted. When songs like “Lose Yourself”, “Stan”, “Not Afraid” and a few others were sung, tears flowed freely, because like every other person, those songs were a part of various struggles and difficulties you  or someone you are close to have faced.    That’s not to say the concert is a downer, no, not at all. Once you’ve wiped your tears away, “Without Me”, “The Real Slim Shady”, “Rap God” and more is performed, to get your body moving, dancing, jumping, flashing, whatever you are in to. Aside from the upbeat tracks, his stage presence is something else, he manages to be filthy and charming all at the same time. And by the end of the show, you’re speechless. Firstly, because you’re in shock due to the fact that you have never experienced a level of such greatness, and secondly, because your voice is gone as rapping alongside the one and only Eminem, is not as easy as he makes it look. ",pos
Eminem,"Eminem in concert in LA was enough to make me extraordinarily happy, but for him to perform some hits from the Recovery album made the entire night absolutely worth it!! It was nostalgic for him to perform his old hits, taking me back to elementary and junior high school days, but Recovery was the album that solidified my love and appreciation for his artistry, talent and heart! Em's portion of the show was absolutely fantastic, he is truly a lyrical genius and he never fails to deliever with an energy and intensity that is infectious! I would have been more than happy (and actually would have preferred) if the show was just his performance, but I can fully understand why he would need someone to fill some time to give him a break between his sets. When he performs it feels like he is literally pouring his heart and soul out on the stage and that has to be beyond exhausting for him, hence the need for Rihanna. Her part was ok.    The venue (the Rose Bowl) was an experience in itself. Parking wasn't as bad as I was anticipating, but it was very expensive. The arena was packed solid, but I never felt too overwhelmed by people even though I was on the floor. It was just great to be surrounded by people who were enjoying the concert.    If you ever have a chance to see Em in concert, I would say, GO! ",pos
Eminem,"I have been a huge Eminem fan since he came out with Cleaning Out My Closet, I was very very young at the time so I've been a fan since I was a little kid. I was very much looking forward to my first Eminem concert, and on 8/16 at MetLife Stadium, my dream finally came true.  The website said they would start at 7:30, but they didn't start until like 8:40, but the whole concert made up for it.   Eminem was amazing, I honestly have no words to describe the experience except that it was very unreal and I had to pinch myself a few times just to make sure this was really happening to me. He played a lot of his songs off his first two albums and then some songs off of Recovery & MMLP2.   For anyone who had seats or had Floor B GA, you really missed out on an amazing view & concert. The view from the 200s & 300s probably sucked, they could only probably see Eminem & Rihanna from the jumbo screens.  Rihanna was great too, she was very sweet & funny live, as well as sexy & seductive.  Eminem was funny and his stage presence was wonderful.  This was an experience I'd LOVE to have again, an experience many should get to enjoy and from the amazing view in GA. I do hope he goes on tour again in the next year or so. ",pos
Eminem,"Fucking amazing!! Man’s music has saved my life so many times! A real artist and an incredible lyricist... unbaleaveablw how much talent Marshal has. Tears dropped as he sung songs that touched my heart and took me back from the grave... I love him for all he has done for me an my recovery... if only I was able to thank him in person... In rehab they say to believe in power that’s greater than me, as my god. Eminem is that god to me. A powerful man that I know has saved so many lives just from his music. The show was the best show I’ve ever attended. Only issue was I wasn’t quick enough to get a ticket I the pit. I would have rocked up at 6am before the concert just to get into the front row and thank the ma. For everything he has done for my life.. But I don’t think I’ll ever get the chance to thanks him and praise Marshal. But I doubt I’ll Ever get the chance to express the abundance of help, love and strength I receive when ever I lisfen  laying down to his tracks!!!  An I doubt he’ll ever truely know how many llivws he has saves and touched!!!  100/10 for the show!!! Bring him back pleaseeee!!! ",pos

Eminem,"Where do I start, right let’s try.... I’ve been lucky enough to see Eminem 3 Times now, first time was v festival where he was absolutely superb and stole the show. Second was at Wembley, where yet again he smashed it, and too bring out dre was unbelievable and the crowd went insane, personally thought, u are not topping that.... but now to twickenham, where I didn’t think he could possibly get any better or fulfill his thousands and thousands of fans, but how stupid was I haha, not only delivers the best show/concert I’ve ever been to and seen but upped the anti and performs the best I’ve ever seen and I’ve seen a few acts, not to finish there, but brings out not just 50 cent but ed sheeran also and the crowd just goes insane and lifted the roof off.... By far the best performer/performance I’ve been luckily enough to witness Regards Darren ",pos
Eminem,"I FINALLY got to see Eminem live after being a fan since day one. What can I say that will do the performance justice? He was AMAZING! Everything that I ever imagined in my mind an Eminem concert would be, well it was 10 times better than that. He was on point with his flow, the sound was awesome, the stage design was great too but honestly I didn't even pay that much attention to that because I was focusing on him the entire time. It was a long time coming for me to see him live and man did he exceed my expectations. Few shows have ever hit that top mark for me and wow he did it. There really are no words that I can say that will give him the credit he deserves for being an amazing artist and performer. All I can say is if you get a chance to watch him, DO IT! You will not be disappointed. I can't wait to be able to watch him again! ",pos
Eminem,"Marshal a.k..a Eminem, you are the best music star ever! I listen to your music everyday becuase I love how you put your anger and pain into the words of your songs, ""I'm Sorry Mama, I never meant to hurt you, I never meant to make you cry"" is one of the best emotional phrases you have used even though you think you have hurt them they will always love you and make sure you are safe. I will always buy your albums when they are released and even try and come to one of your concerts, hopefully meaning I get to meet you and ask for a picture with you and ask you nicely to sign my albums and posters I have. You are my favourite singer of all time. I am your biggest fan ever! From Curtis P.S. You are the best, hopefully I get to meet you and that would be the best day of my life I would never forget it and never forget you! ",pos
Eminem,"Eminem is epic. Eminem live is mind blowing!   Live he performs a great variety of songs from all of his albums, mixing in some of his old stuff which brings feelings of nostalgia with his newer stuff which sounds great.   He has got to be one of the best rappers of all time and the fact that he writes all his lyrics himself gives the songs depth and meaning. He's a lyrical genius!   Watching him live is a roller coaster of emotions from jumping up and down and going wild to swaying your hands in the air with a sing-a-long.   Even though Wembley held thousands he still performed like it was to each and every one of you, interacting with the crowd and showing off his great sense of humor.  Eminem is amazing and I would highly recommend seeing him live, there's no feeling like it. ",pos
Eminem,"Phenomenal. Just as with his Wembley Stadium show 4 years prior, Eminem executed a powerful performance of a diverse array of classics spanning his whole career. He demonstrated why he is heralded by many as not only the greatest Hip Hop artist of all time, but one of the most iconic artists in music still today. Seeing him reunite with 50 Cent on stage was a fan-pleasing nostalgia trip of legend. Ed Sheeran, Royce Da 5'9 and Skylar Grey also helped to light the stage and prestige even further. This was the perfect experience for Slim Shady fans. Utterly remarkable. ",pos
Eminem,"I am very very anxious to see him soon I hope!!! Listen to him as long as I can remember his first album!!! I pray he comes somewhere near ALABAMA soon!!! It would make my millennium!!!! If u see this M, I want u to know that I am a 43 year old man and I been listening to you forever it seems like and would love for my wife and I to see u live!!!! Keep on keeping on! You r my favorite music artist! God really gave u a talent that I wish I could have! Good luck with the rest of your career and God bless! ",neu
Eminem,"Considering I have been a massive fan of Eminem since I was introduced to his music at the tender age of Seven; I believe I did a great job of staying calm. Despite waiting a long time for the legend himself to appear on stage, the concert exceeded all expectations! Eminem, Shady and Marshal Mathers were all present at the gig and he just emits brilliance. I can honestly say it was one of the best concerts I have been to in. Eminem is a brilliant artist and he was worth all the money spent. ",pos
Eminem,"Absolutely amazing, the energy he put off was incredible. He played a lot of his old classic songs that every time loves and of course some new stuff. I got to experience Kamikaze section front row and it was well worth the wait, money and the aches and pains. He was that incredible I could of stood there for a further 5 hours watching his show All round what a great preformer, brilliant artist and he really showed why he is our rap god. ",pos
Eminem,"An amazing and energic concert. An amazing feeling and Im soo moved. The downside thought is the arena which isn't the best one for the viewrs, from a big areana where you almost can see the stage whater your 400meters from the stage on the side or the oposite side of the arena, the sound isn't really the best either and the caos when 57000 people are trying to get out and you get stuck and can't move. But other than that it's a 10 out of 10 ",neu
Eminem,"It was absolutely amazing... It was Eminem and Rihanna on August 17th. They were half an hour late which is fine. The production was amazing, Rihanna is a goddess and Eminem is a god. Everything was perfect, the set list had everything it should. MetLife Stadium is a great venue as well. Unfortunately the transportation back to NY was chaotic, but far from spoiling what an amazing concert we had. Truly amazing ",pos
Eminem,"Seeing Eminem is a dream that every person that's grown up in the 90's wishes to tick off their bucket list! Seeing him last year at reading was amazing, 50,000+ people singing along to every word of his songs! I can't explain how euphoric it was! and with his return to wembley this year I'm sure it'll be just as crazy as last year! Can't wait! ",pos
Eminem,I haven't seen him but love his music I relate to it I'm 52 but when I'm 70 I'll still lission to him. I'm in Iowa cedar rapids I'm begging him to come here he has a lot of fans here.

Eminem,"It was perfect!! I like that security staff was very friendly and reacting so quickly if something were going wrong. WC were really very clean. We were stayed in the first line so our shoes were dry, so we were lucky because it was raining a little bit. Eminem was unreal, we love it and we will comeback :) ",pos
Maroon 5,"Sometimes when you hear a band that you love perform live for the first time, you're a bit disappointed because they do not sound as great as they do in the recordings. Well, that is NOT the case with Maroon 5, what you hear on recording is what you get live. Adam Levine has an amazing voice. He is super talented, and they made no mistake when they decided to make him a judge on the show, The Voice. I could watch him perform live with his band all day. Some of my very favorite songs by Maroon 5 are their old ones such as “Never Gonna Leave This Bed”, “Harder To Breathe”, and “Misery” but when they start singing “Payphone”, I go crazy. I absolutely love this song performed live! Perhaps the best song to see them perform live is “Moves Like Jagger”. It makes you move when you hear it on the radio, but when you hear it live, you're dancing non stop. Maroon 5 concerts are mostly upbeat and fun, but there are times when it slows down and they perform those songs that make you want to call your ex. The atmosphere to their concerts is just right. Chill at times, but also upbeat and loud. Put Maroon 5 on your list of bands to see live because you will not be disappointed. ",pos
Maroon 5,"Maroon 5 have been constant and consistent in the charts over their long career which now spans almost fifteen years. The band, fronted by Adam Levine has come along way since the immediate success with 'Songs For Jane'. Now working on their sixth album, they obtain a consistency within their live show to match. Armed with a plethora of hits, the band tear into 'One More Night' from the 2012 album 'Overexposed'. The audience singalong as Levine confidently struts around the stage commanding his loyal followers. A good mixture of material old and new make for a solid setlist where the band are able to show consistency through their recordings as the likes of 'Sunday Morning' and 'Maps' sit well together and achieve an equally positive reaction. A real track of the 00's, 'She Will Be Loved' makes for perhaps the largest singalong of the evening as the crowd proudly attempt the high, long notes in the same way Adam does during the chorus. Evidently hitting their stride with latest album 'V', Maroon 5 impress crowds by remaining as relevant now as they were during their incarnation back in 2002. ",pos
Maroon 5,"This is my second show in the last 2 years and neither time was I disappointed in the least.  This time I was fortunate enough to have the money I saved to purchase pretty good seats. I am now spoiled and can no longer sit in the stands.  I am already saving my money for the next US tour in hopes to be even closer next show.  No matter where your seats though....Adam is all over the stage in high energy, which is very infectious!!  Anyone who did not enjoy that show, must not have been paying attention.  They sounded awesome live...awesome!!  Adam made the audience feel as though they were part of the show and VERY, VERY much appreciated!  The lights were perfect, the set list was awesome as well.  They played much longer than most people expected and the encore was just as great as the rest of the show, maybe even better.  Maybe that is because I am partial to ""Moves Like Jagger"" and there it was....This was worth every dollar I paid, which was way more than I would pay to see anyone but maroon 5!!  If  you get a chance to see them sometime....make it a point....you will fall in love!! ",pos
Maroon 5,"IT WAS SOOOOOO AMAZING. they played all the songs i grew up listening to so all the memories just came flooding in and it was simply the best experience EVERR! seeing my favs live in concert was so LIT. What Lovers Do, Payphone, Maps, Cold, Sugar, Sunday Morning, Wait, Girls Like You, This Love AND MOVES LIKE JAGGER WOOO these are all my favourites and they played all of them AND MORE!!! i can’t barely describe how amazing this experience was. i was a bit upset that they didn’t perform an encore and some songs from the album that i really thought would be played like Help Me Out and Whiskey. from what my sister told me, Maroon 5 performed an encore last time round so i was quite let down when the concert ended without an one this time. nevertheless, it was a still a fantastic performance and i really hope to see them again soon!!!

Maroon 5,"No food allowed into the event, and the only food available from vendors was junk food (3-4 different pizza vendors, 2-3 sub vendors), not 1 single option for those wishing to eat healthy (not even a freaking salad was available anywhere). Paid over $300 for ""zone 1 seating"", which was PACKED and there really was no ""seating"" as it was on the beach and turned into a free for all battle for a spot. Lines into and out of ""seating zones"" were HORRIBLE throughout the ENTIRE event! The shitty food vendors were located past ""zone 3"" which meant that getting a bite to eat was about an hour process for those of us in zone 1! Absolutely the last time I'm ever attending a concert at this venue! As for the show itself, Maroon V was good, but for some reason decided to only play 3-4 songs from their new album.. Go figure. ",neg
Maroon 5,"I've been waiting to see Maroon 5 for 6 years and I'm so glad I finally did it. I love that they didn't lose the essence of them as a pop rock band and a as a collective of musicians rather than just Adam Levine, especially since that's what it seems like in recent albums V and Red Pill Blues. They started the show with videos and interacted a lot with the audience which made it a memorable show! That said, Adam Levines voice was a little off... most of the time. He can't hit high notes and instead of really singing the lyrics sometimes it seemed like he was talking. Still enjoyed the solos and appreciate that they played more ""rock"" songs like Harder To Breathe as well as their very recent pop music. ",neu
Maroon 5,"The band was really good at times, but Adam Levine did not seem to be at his best. Entire show including encore was 1:20. No real effects, which is ok, if the music is great, but no one was super impressed with the performance. Maybe an off day. If you are thinking about getting the VIP package- DON'T! Complete rip off and Maroon 5 and VIP Nations EU should be ashamed. Grocery bag with Maroon 5 on it, a lanyard, a silk screen pillow (seriously), and cheap sunglasses. No band photos, certainly no pictures with you and the band, no autographed anything. Complete and utter SH*T for your extra money.

Maroon 5,"I'm sure it was a fantastic concert.  I had grabbed two great seats back on the first day they went on sale. Health issues have pretty much made me housebound since February 2008. But I was willing to pay the ticket price just in case I felt well enough to go Wednesday night the decision had to be made once and for all.  I was scheduled to fly from Kansas City MO to Nashville the next day. Saddened last night that I missed the concert, just one more thing my illness got in the way of my leading a normal or semi normal life. I decided to just listen to Maroon 5 downloads on my IPad  and hope that I can make the Kansas City show in March. ",neu
Maroon 5,"I missed them every time they came to Toronto. Finally got to see them live and it was everything I thought it would be. The band was top notch, the stage setup was simple but it gave such a different look. Minus the little mini blackout and tantrum that Adam had (he also threw the mic on the floor and it inadvertently hit a fan on the head - she was fine) Adam was nice enough to pull her on stage and apologize even though we couldn't hear a single thing lol Adam's voice was on point. I didn't want the concert to end. I will definitely see them again when they come back, hopefully I don't miss out on tickets again ",pos
Maroon 5,"In my view, D J's participation at the beginning was too long, which only increased our wait and anxiety to see Maroon5. The place where it was extremely organized and it was possible for everyone present to enjoy an incredible presentation with a very cool setlist of “new” and “older” songs. For me it was a great show and certainly worth it! Levine on stage is awesome as are all the members, always moving around and making jokes between them and the audience. Concert highly recommended!",pos
Maroon 5,"The band's performance was wonderful. Note 1000 !!! I would just like to leave a suggestion to the event organizers regarding the layout of the venue. He has been to concerts at Jeunesse Arena before and the closed space is more appropriate for this type of event due to the heat of the city of Rio de Janeiro, the possibility of contemplating the show of the chairs, the protection in the case of rain and the air conditioning that it certainly benefits the musician / band that is not used to our heat. Ao Maroon Five: come back anytime you want!",pos
Maroon 5,"I expected so much! I loved Maroon 5 and Adam Levine and their songs will stay in my heart even after this big disappointment. I was looking ahead for jokes, connection with us (the public), even a 'Hello, Bucharest' would have made me happy. Instead, we got a cold and arrogant attitude, no more than 100 words addressed to us during the entire show, and some 'We love you, you're extraordinary, we'll be back' thrown in our faces at the end. Duty fulfilled, paycheck cashed in. They did not deserve the public they got! Yes, Mommy, yes! ",neg
Maroon 5,"Great concert Loved the energy and sound. The engagement with the audience was wonderful not too forced. Only thing I didn't like was the playlist of songs. Really wished they would have done some of their other music.  Like ;Little of your time, Stutter, Shudder, Tangled, Man who never lied, Let's stay together, and If I ain't got you. Adams voice in the last two songs sounds like velvet.  Will see them again. TOV Lo was very good  R City ok didn't know much of their music they sing. Tammy J McCrary Kincaid ",pos
Maroon 5,"WOW!!!!  We had fantastic seats near the stage however, wherever you were sitting/standng you experienced a great concert.  Adam sang non-stop for the first 20mins or so and what a voice!!  He included all their classics - payphone, jagger etc as well as their current album.  And to top it at the end, they had decided to film their next video - such fun.  Great night, amazing concert, perfect venue!  Want to do it all again asap! ",pos
Maroon 5,The most Fun concert ever! This was the  third time I brought my niece to see Maroon 5. We were singing and dancing the entire concert. The most entertaining and highly energetic performance with amazing vocals. I have been a fan for many years and I love sharing the experience with my niece who is equally appreciative. Thank you for setting the bar for our concert going experiences for 2015. Much love from Minneapolis. ,pos
Maroon 5,"so good. I sat up in the top section, but the view was still incredible and my friend and I had an amazing time. the lights added onto the emotion of each song. I cried during Sunday Morning, just because it was amazing to finally hear such an important song to me live. Adam's beautiful. There was a drunk girl who jumped up on stage and tried to kiss him, but other than that, it was a flawless concert. ",pos
Maroon 5,"Boooring!!! The concert was very plain, no punch at any time. It was Mexico City, come on!!! the audince there is amazing!!! It would have been better to sit at home and watch their concert on TV. When you thought it couldnt get worst, it ended!! it was only 1:20 minutes. Althoght I had great seats and Adam Levine is super hot, my conclusion is that it was a short, boring and expensive concert. ",neg
Ed Sheeran,"Great show! I bought my wife and I tickets as a gift for her (she was a huge Ed Sheeran fan even before he was famous) and we had a great time. My wife had never been to the venue, and while I had been to shows at Consol Enery Center before this was the first show I saw there since it became PPG Paints Arena. Everything about the production and performances (lights, audio, visuals, crew, musicians etc) went off with nary a hitch and was executed in a very timely manner. Props to all involved. James Blunt opened, and like many people there (as he joked) I only knew one of his songs: ""You're Beautiful"". He was funny, charismatic, a good showman, and a good sport. He put on a high quality emotion filled performance, and despite his music being on the sadder side still managed to pump everyone up for Ed Sheeran. ""Don't Give Me Those Eyes"" was a highlight. He hung out in the Captain Morgan lounge after his performance and invited anyone interested to come hang with him. I came in not really knowing who he was and left checking out his latest music and regretting not grabbing a beer with him. Than Ed came out (my wife had a pinch me I'm dreaming moment). He was noticeably quieter and a bit more reserved than Blunt when addressing the audience, but quickly dove in. I was always aware Ed was a talented solo artist, but you really appreciate his talent on a different level when you actually hear him perform outside of a studio live with just him and a guitar. Most of his songs were studio quality. A few songs dipped in quality but for charming and understandable reasons like audience involvement and impressive sped-up improv (i.e. the ""Don't"" and ""New Man"" mashup). He played nearly all the songs my wife and I were looking for (""Perfect"", ""A-Team"", ""Galway Girl"", ""Nancy Mulligan"", ""Thinking Out Loud"", etc.). Since this was the ""Divide"" tour he played almost every song off that album (but not all: no ""Barcelona"", ""Bibia be ye ye"", etc.) He also played a lot of his older songs, including an audience request for ""Cold Coffee"" (he stated it was the first time he performed it live since 2010-2011). I also liked how he put on a Pittsburgh Penguins jersey during his closing song ""You Need Me and I Don't Need You"". TLDR it was one of the best shows I have seen. ",pos
Ed Sheeran,"It is safe to say that Ed Sheeran will be one of the defining artists of our generation. His music transcends any definable genre, combining soft folk with bright pop and grime hip-hop. Sheeran's clever wordplay and soulful lyrics are able to really captivate an audience, both when listening to him live or on a CD. One of the most salient qualities about him though, is his pure, unaltered, truly beautiful voice.    It is hard to really visualize how great he sounds until you see him live. I was lucky enough to see him at a small, intimate performance with a crowd of only about 100. The first thing you notice about him is that it is just him up on stage. There is no band, no backing vocals, no track playing in the background or anything. It is him, a guitar, and a loop pedal. From the moment he struck the first chord until the moment he stepped off stage, the audience was enchanted by him. His voice can transport you from an old pub in Ireland to the grimy streets of London without ever missing a beat. A real troubadour, his shining moments are the ballads in which soaring vocals and romantic lyrics backed by the simple strum of his Little Martin cause major swooning. It was evident to me that Sheeran deserves all of the attention he gets and more; his talent is truly undeniable, even if he isn't your favorite. He is so incredibly down-to-Earth, as well. I was able to meet him after he performed and he genuinely cared about what I had to say to him. He was warm, friendly, funny, and exceedingly normal. He's someone that you would want to hang out and watch TV with. With his new album ""x"" (pronounced ""multiply"") Sheeran shows how much he has grown as an artist since the release of his debut album ""+"" three years ago. His love is more passionate, his hurt is more palpable, and when he throws shade, it's pretty intense. At the end of the day, he is a performer. You can tell how much music means to him when you see him live. He is a true artist: a beautiful lyricist, a stunning vocalist, and an incredibly entertaining musician. ",pos
Ed Sheeran,"Let me just start off by saying Ed Sheeran is an amazing performer and speaker. He is comedic and doesn't require thousands of lights and a massive stage to impress thousands. He stayed interactive with the crowd very well. This is my 3rd concert ever and it was both the best and worst I have ever. Ed Sheeran did amazing, he isn't the issue. As people know in concerts you stand and dance to most songs and sit (under circumstances) when ballads are playing or the performer is speaking. So- I was standing during one of Ed Sheeran's many sings along/dancing songs. I am a 6 foot tall 13 years old there for my birthday. In the area, I was in many people asked me to sit while he talked which I happily obliged to then learning the rules. It was all fine until one man yelled in a very rude/angry voice yelled at me (during a dancing song) ""SIT DOWN IDIOT IN THE BLACK HAT."" Which at the very moment I didn't recognize as myself until my father went to lash back (as any protective super concert dad would do). This is something I had never experienced. So for the rest of the concert, I sat having an emotional/mental breakdown. I'm not sure if it was the music or the people that made me cry so much. This was an experience I will learn from. Unfortunately, it is (probably) because Ed Sheeran reins in a large age group as an audience. This means sometimes people will be cranky, rude, or just plain snarky. I understand if someone handicapped asked me to sit because they couldn't stand. But this man that yelled at me was about 50 or younger. I hope he ended up enjoying his concert because by halfway through my whole 6' or taller family stood and danced. He sat and everyone around him was asking him to join. Sorry for my rant. Ed Sheeran is an amazing performer. I just thought you should know that people that (I know) will be everywhere (and we cant do much about them). But it was rude. ",pos
Ed Sheeran,"Ed was fantastic! He played with no band or backtrack, but instead recorded himself and looped it as he went along to create the illusion of a backtrack or band. With only one person on stage in such a huge arena, there was a lot of opportunity to for the show to grow dry or redundant, especially for those sitting far away. However, he managed to keep me entertained the whole show with an AMAZING graphic show to accompany him. Each of his songs had a unique visual and light show that included scenes from music videos, new visuals, and video to project his performance. There was so much to look at I didn't even mind sitting far away (second level). He was also very interactive with the crowd, asking us to sing along for most songs, telling stories, and even managing to request and achieve (near) complete silence from the audience during the few songs he deemed needed it. He's got just as amazing of a voice live as on his albums and managed to play all of my personal favorite songs in the span of his set, including a nice mixture of ""plus"" and ""multiply"" Plus, his rapping is 10x more impressive live. Between being his own DJ, spitting out verses quicker than I thought possible, and jumping around stage, it's hard to find out when he has time to breathe. But he kept his energy up throughout the whole show. The exciting surprise of the event was during the encore, when he started singing ""Chasing Cars"" and was joined on stage by Gary Lightbody of Snow Patrol. He ended the snow and left the stage with his single ""Sing"" still looping, leaving the song and his performance stuck in everyone's head for the rest of the night.    Overall, he was a skilled entertainer, one I would Definitially recommend to all who enjoy his music. ",pos
Ed Sheeran,"I have seen 300 concerts. This evening is in my top ten. The sheet quality of his songs, what he achieves with his looping, and the visuals on the screen were excellent. There were a few occasions during the night when Ed was bashing away at his guitar, lost in that massive cacophony,of sound, that I thought that the Budweiser Gardens might blast off into space! Excellent. Ed also has a powerful voice and a fairly extensive knowledge of soul music. Some of the snippets he threw into songs last night were fantastic. There were some transcendental moments in that show were I felt that anything could happen. People were stunned. Also, the way that he deconstructed some of the fan favourites was very interesting to watch and listen to. All that said, I think needs some assistance in creating more flow to the show and in reaching out to his audience in a meaningful way. He is 24. His songs are unreal. He knows how good he is. I hope that the stagecraft develops further with maturity. Songs like Photograph and Thinking Out Loud were a bit understated. Again, the quality of the songs allowed for a successful delivery. However, a song like Thinking out Loud is one for the ages. People will connect to that song forevermore. That piece needs to be a showstopper; a song that leaves the audiences emotional avd feeling connected to each other. He did not deliver in this department last night. His delivery on songs like this felt a bit selfish - a bit of a disappointment. Ed Sheeran might level off in terms of the songs that he delivers to the world. If, on the other hand, they keep getting better we could be looking at a new kind of stardom. This boy is unreal. The world owns this guy now. ",pos
Ed Sheeran,"I don't know if it was the galavanting with Taylor Swift, but I know what you are thinking… Ed Sheeran is a ginger with a One Direction pre-teen fanatic following, and I'm not sure if I want to experience that live. Well I am here to tell you, you do. You really need to see Ed Sheeran live the next chance you get. I've been a fan of Ed Sheeran since I first heard ""You Need Me"" in 2011. Since then, Ed Sheeran has exploded, touring with Snow Patrol and (of course) Tay Swifty. I'm not sure if it was the time spent with Gary Lightbody and Snow Patrol, but Ed Sheeran has refined his songwriting to pull at your heartstrings and bring you on a 3 minute plus journey of love, loss, and sometimes revenge. When I had an opportunity to see him live for the first time this year, he was playing a massive stadium in Philadelphia.  I was as ready as I could be for all the screaming pre-teens, but looking around before the show started the thing that surprised me most was the stage set up: two mics, two guitars and a loop pedal at the very front of the stage. The next couple hours were a thrilling experience of watch Ed Sheeran build his songs from those 3 things, using his guitar as drums, layering vocals to harmonize with himself, and using the crowd as an award winning choir. With all of the production on the new album, I completely expected him to have a huge band on stage. Yet, just as he had done when he first started on the street and at open mic nights, Ed Sheeran played completely by himself… in a stadium. This is definitely a case of the pop music world getting it right… Ed Sheeran is a huge talent who deserves to be massive, and you will agree next time you see him live. ",pos
Ed Sheeran,"After a 4.5hr drive to see the show we weren’t disappointed! Lewis Capaldi was first up and as funny and great as ever. Had the crowd laughing. The Darkness were not my thing but they engaged with one particular guy called “Rick” in the crowd, who also sang his heart out for an appreciative audience. The main man Ed appeared on stage around 8.30pm with a huge smile on his face, to an immense welcome from the Ipswich crowd, he was born not too far away, so was nice to see him finish this huge 2 year world tour at home. Also he gave hundreds of free tickets to the pupils of the school he attended when he lived there. His vocals were simply incredible, loud, strong, smooth and steamy,  just beautiful !! Screen graphics and timings were perfect too. His guitar playing was awesome to watch and I have no idea how he concentrates on so many things at once with the loop, that is pure talent and the build up and sound in some songs ie Eraser, Bloodstream and the awesome You need me,I don’t need you gave me goosebumps. Ed was joined for Galway Girl by Beoga which was brilliant. Special guest Stormzy for “Shape of You” was the icing on the cake and I’m so pleased I bought the tickets last year, they were worth every penny. Only complaint was the rude and miserable guy behind the official merch counter!! Spending £50 on a hoodie for my daughter meant I had to save for it and it would have been nice to have had a “hello” a “thank-you” or any kind of a smile!!! Luckily the bar staff were friendly, smiley and helpful as were the local people. Would 100% recommend ED SHEERAN as someone to see live, he is INCREDIBLE. Mandy x ",pos
Ed Sheeran,"Seeing Ed Sheeran live was an incredible experience. Ed is not just a singer, but a brilliant artist, because every song of his is a work of art. He is 23 years old and he has released two albums, twelve EPs and collaborated with many successful artists. If you doubt about seeing him live, because you're not really a big fan and you know a few of his most successful songs (The A-team, Lego House, Drunk, Give Me Love) - don't doubt my friend. Why?   Let me tell you why. You know this feeling when you have to drive to a concert and you're already exhausted and the summer heat is making you all giddy? And then you have to wait in line and the heat is really bothering you? Well my friend, you forget all about it once Mr. Sheeran comes to the stage. The way he presents himself and his music is brilliant. He's just one man on the stage but he is all over the place. He makes sure we are all listening to him and not just screaming whenever he opens his mouth and a beautiful note comes out. During some of the songs you need to be quiet, and oh boy, we were quiet. It was like the crowd was holding their breath. Something I really like about him, is that he is just a simple human being with an amazing talent that he wants to share with the world. He plays mostly in smaller arenas so he can connect more with the crowd. If you are a fan of acoustic artists and small venues - then his concert is definitely for you.    I would highly recommend you go to Ed's concert even if you only know one song of his. He is absolutely amazing and his gigs are an incredible experience for everybody. ",pos
Ed Sheeran,"I fell in love with Ed's music a few years ago, a little before the big hype about him (of which there is every need to be). I loved his first album and all his ""old"" songs (pre-+) like ones in The songs I wrote with Amy and X (Mulitply) is just even better.  I knew he would be amazing live, because any live lounges or live performances I've watched of his have been brilliant.  What I love is that it's just him, his guitar and his loop pedal – no band or back-up singers which is something quite unique to him. That, I think, makes a more personal connection with him and the crowd so, even parents who didn't particularly want to be there could be involved as well with clapping etc.  He seems really genuine and down-to-earth through his performances too as he doesn't have anything too flashy – just a couple screens behind him so everyone can see him. And of course, just jeans and a t-shirt.  He had a good mix of up-beat and slow songs and songs with a slow start and build up which I really liked. He also added things to the songs like adding other parts of songs to the end or adding an extra verse than from what's on the album (eg. You need me, I don't need you).  His love performance consisted mostly of songs from his new album, X but also many songs from + and a few older songs too like Gold Rush.  I was definitely recommend listening to and going to a concert of Ed's because his music is for everyone and he is definitely a crowd-pleaser. ",pos
Ed Sheeran,"James Blunt was the opening act, with Ed Sheeran as the main.  The show started right on time, which doesn't always happen in my experience. Blunt had a hit with ""Beautiful"" in the states a while back and we haven't heard much from him since, so he poked fun at himself on stage and put on a great show. The crowd may have come to see Ed Sheeran, but Blunt set a great mood for the rest of the show, ending with an upbeat song.  He is the self proclaimed singer of ""miserable songs"", yet he ended his set on a positive note and crowd participation. Ed Sheeran's show started a bit after James Blunt's performance ended, 15 minutes maybe. As we already know, he's an incredibly gifted and talented artist. His set was beautiful, with a lot of graphics on the screens to go with the songs. I do wish that on some songs they'd shown him more on the big screens, since it's those of us sitting further back couldn't see him as well.  That's fine though, it was still worth it.  He ended with ""Shape of You"", which made our daughter very happy since she's not yet 9, that's one of her favorite songs, and this was her first concert. Tacoma Dome was the venue, the concert and venue were great, the parking and way out, not so much. It was a total cluster and $30 parking for an outdoor lot with no real direction is not good, in my opinion. If there was actual traffic control to help leaving the concert, it would have been perfect. That's my only gripe. ",pos
Ed Sheeran,"Ed Sheeran is probably the most talented man alive, thought surprisingly not many people know about Ed Sheeran. He is a singer song writer with an incredible voice who stands on stage with a guitar and a loop pedal. He builds the music right in front of you, singing the background melodies and strumming the guitar until the music is perfect and than he starts singing his songs. This is my third time seeing Ed Sheeran, and it won't be my last. The ""Ginger Jesus"" as many fans call him opened with ""I'm a Mess"" which is one of my personal favorites. He continued building beats and playing my favorite songs throughout the whole night and there was never a boring moment. Another personal favorite is when Ed (he's soo cute) requests the crowd to be completely silent, no singing, NO SCREAMING, and no talking. Eventually the crowd quiets down and everyone is shushing each other while he beautifully sings ""Afire Love"" which is a song he wrote in tribute to his grandfather. The concert went by so fast and we were suddenly chanting for ""More Ed"". Naturally, he came back and gave us the most incredible performance I have ever seen in my life singing ""You Need Me, I Don't Need You"" I can't even describe it. Of course he sang A-Team, which is such a beautiful song and ""Sing"". Ed Sheeran is so humble and honestly, one of the most talented people of our generation. ",pos
Ed Sheeran,"It takes a lot of talent to make grown men squeal like teenage girls at a concert but Ed Sheeran did just that.   From the second he walks on stage the energy in the room changes. From first sight of that ginger hair the entire crowd went insane. The relation between the venue size and the amount of noise that was being produced was astounding. However, his cool presence can also make an entire room go silent. It takes true talent to quiet a room of teenage girls.    On the other hand, the audience that his music appeals to was various. Although I arrived at 7:30 am for the general admission show (which started at 7pm) there were also many older fans and an almost even ration of male to female.   You can tell by his expressions ( and the countless ""thank-you's) that Ed is truly grateful to be where he is today. The way he gets the crowd involved is unbelievable. He has them sing the back up vocals while he plays the loop pedal and sings lead. This one man can create the sounds of an entire band. At various times throughout the show I stopped singing along just to hear his amazing voice and take in what was actually happening in front of my eyes.   Closing the show with his latest hit ""Sing"", he left the crowd singing all the way into their cars. Never have I seen such a genuine performer with such talent. X. ",pos
Ed Sheeran,"After seeing Ed live, I've fallen 100 times more in love with him. Wembley Stadium is a big place so I was initially concerned that my seat was too far away from all the excitement (as it was in the back half of the stadium and highest level of assigned seating) however I was grateful to find this was wrong as Sheeran's stage presence captured the entire stadium. His warm up acts- Foy Vance and One Republic- were also brilliant. One of the first things Sheeran said upon coming onto the stage was that no one cares what you're doing so dance like crazy and everyone has to lose their voice by the end of the show; despite the size of his audience, it was comforting to be spoken to almost as an individual. Many of his songs had a faster tempo than recorded on the CD which made them far more exciting, for example, one of my favourites, 'I'm a mess'. He gave an emotional performance of 'Afire love' from his second album for which he introduced as a ""very personal (song) to (him)"". I think many people connect more to artists like Sheeran because of the whole-heartedness and sincerity of his shows. I'm embarrassingly jealous of fans who are seeing him over the next few nights and I'm keen to get tickets for his next tour (providing he brings out another smash of an album- who am I kidding of course he will) ",pos
Ed Sheeran,"I'm so glad I went to see Ed Sheeran perform live! I'd watched a couple of videos on Youtube of past concerts, so I knew that he would put on a good show, but it was better than I even expected. The people in the row behind me were very confused as the time neared for Ed to go on, commenting that the stage was still fairly empty of equipment-- All of the audio during the show comes from his voice, his acoustic guitars (which get swapped out between songs, presumably to replace strings), and loop pedals, which is amazing. Setting up the layers for each song was seamlessly integrated into the performance. Visuals on moving screens behind him were a perfect backdrop/tie-in to the music, organically integrating live footage of Ed on stage with color, animated graphics and excerpts from his music videos, and the stage lighting was effectively atmospheric. Ed's singing voice and vocal gymnastics during his raps are flawless, as were his medleys of his own songs and covers, which are a lot of fun. You can tell from his exuberance that he loves performing and having the crowd sing along, which happened on nearly every song. I was legitimately losing my voice near the end XD The overall energy of the performance was fantastic and absolutely worth going to see this immense talent on stage! ",pos
Ed Sheeran,"Well, I'm french so I apologize for my bad English. My friend and I have been waited for 5 months to see him and we were absolutely not disappointed. The concert began with Ryan Keen , who is extremely talented with his guitar. I really liked it. After he finished we waited 30mn Ed Sheeran..... And here he is. This cutie ginger with his guitar started to sing I'm Mess, and at this moment everybody moved their hands in the air and screaming and blah blah blah. I was a little surprised by one thing; I always see Ed during his shows anywhere asking to the audience to be quiet. Even when it was a TV show, buuut most of the time during this concert, he said to us ""Sing with me .... Don't stop..... Keep the rhythm.....etc,etc"" So it was pretty cool to show him that we know his lyrics, to show our support and love. Eventough I think it is much cooler to let him sing, let him drives you anywhere with his INCREDIBLE voice ,I have to say. Just looking at him and think Damn he is a good singer and moved me by his sensibility and honesty in his voice and songs. Words which describe this show could be simple but effective, Honest, generous, human, and talented. I will see him again, that's for sure. And I recommend to see him live, it is better. xx ",pos
Ed Sheeran,"Small intimate venue for a special night with Ed Sheeran. Enjoyed the warm-up DJ and how he mixed well-known tunes together. Mahalia (support act) had a great voice that entertained us before the main man took to the stage. Ed treated us to a mixture of songs from his 3 albums. Castle on the Hill was a great start. Galway Girl, Nancy Mulligan & You Need Me, I Don’t Need You were other stand out tracks & I was so glad he responded to the audience request for Barcelona. He kept us entertained with stories & his energy and played almost a 2 hour set right up to curfew at 11pm - in fact he wasn’t able to finish with Sing as I would have expected. The only downsides - the cloakroom was not open as we came in. I was told it would be open when everyone was in the venue - my wife is only 5’2” tall (I’m 6’2) so she struggles to see at gigs. People in front of her recording whole songs impacted her ability to see - We found a spot near the sound desk. In quieter moments of Ed’s set we could hear bottles being thrown into recycle bins by bar staff at bar behind us & loud chatter from around the bar. I can never understand why people pay to go to gigs and talk all the way through Overall though an amazing night ",neu
Ed Sheeran,"Ed Sheeran is an amazing entertainer. He possesses the rare ability to stand alone on a stage in front of thousands with just a guitar, microphone, and looping station. He travels lightly, requiring no band or moving stage parts. His intricate melodies are never the same in two shows. Sheeran mashes songs up, sneaks in a classic or two, and incorporates lyrics from current hits. He constantly keeps his fans engaged, giving them harmony parts to repeat, and even gets chaperoning parents tapping their feet to the beat. The diversity of the Suffolk singer's fans is incredible, ranging from fangirling tweens to accompanying husbands and boyfriends who do not initially expect to enjoy the event. ""The Man"" is a musical genius, able to easily transition from a quiet love song to an exhilerating rap, leaving the room ""Drunk"" with anticipation for what is coming next. He can please a crowd just as well as, if not better than, a seasoned performer with a full band, props, and costumes. Most amazingly, he remains humble and true to his roots, a normal twenty-four year old, refusing to let the fame go to his head. Sheeran paints a picture that is most definitely worth witnessing. ",pos
Ed Sheeran,"It has been an incredible show! It was my first concert, I didn't know that this could such a great emotion to feel under the skin. My heart had an earthquake literally,it was that kind of emotion that rips out your soul and sews it with new pieces filled with that music that has conquered your everything. Ed Sheeran has an incredible voice, he's an angel on this earth and, with his wings, he generates the will to fly. I've been lucky for having the possibility to go to his concert and it has been and always will be the best event of this year and my life. Anytime now that I listen to his songs, I cry, but those tears are filled with happiness. It's been the first time in my life that I wept with joy! I'm not a lukcy girl and, for once in my life, I felt so well and I still feel well, I feel that, from now on, everything will be okay.This concert changed my life, Ed Sheeran saved me! Ed Sheeran is a superhero for me, he has the power to make people believe that this Earth is the most beautiful place to belong to. He'll be for eva in my heart, every beat has a musical note of his songs, his music pumps in my bloodstream, he's perfect to me! ",pos
Ed Sheeran,"Ed Sheeran at Wembley was absolutely incredible. I have no words to describe how much fun me and my boyfriend had. Starting from the fact that both of his opening acts, Jamie Lawson and Anne-Marie, were both amazing and full of energy, I think the capacity that Ed has of putting on a show in front of 100,000 people with only his voice and his guitar are beyond words. Even though I was a tad disappointed because there was not a special guest, differently from the nights before where Stormzy and Andrea Bocelli joined on stage, I had a great time and sang and danced to every song. Ed was very interactive and we all had a laugh when he made jokes and it was nice to see how passionate he is when he performs. He genuinely wants every single person to have a good time and spend those couple of hours with a constant smile on the face. I felt a bit emotional when he sang some songs like Lego House or Photograph, and I danced and jumped during Nancy Mulligan. I am very grateful for getting to see him, especially on such a massive tour. Definitely would recommend to anyone and would see him again any time! 18/06/2018 - Giulia Tramontana ",pos
Ed Sheeran,"Hi, my name is Bianca and I am here to tell you about my experience at Divide Tour Brazil in Belo Horizonte. I've never imagine that one day, Ed could came to BH, so when it was announced the dates for the tour in Brazil and the name of the city where I live was on the list, I was in shock, I cried and cried because I knew, at that moment, that I could not let go. 82 days of waiting since the purchase of the ticket, much anxiety and animation. Finally 05/30/2017, one of the best day of my life. I fulfilled the dream of going to the most cute redhead, show I've ever met. When he came on stage, it seemed like the floor would collapse, the audience would scream, sing and jump a lot, we were lucky to have Give Me Love on the setlist and it was wonderful. I have no words to describe what I felt at the moment, I know it was a mixture of sadness, knowing that it would end, and happiness, knowing that I was there, fulfilling one of my dreams. I just wanna thank Ed for the wonderful experience and for the show. I really hope that he come back very soon, I already miss him, hahaha. That was my Ed's concert experience! ",pos
Bruno Mars,"I went to a Bruno Mars concert last night, and I thought it was great. When I first got there, everyone was really hyped up and excited, and the mood was contagious. The merchandise were cool, though it was very expensive (but what else do you expect at a concert?). Aloe Blacc went on before Bruno and sang some of his famous songs, and later came out to sign autographs.  When Bruno finally came out, he did so with a big bang (literally, it sounded like a gunshot). Throughout the concert, he remained energetic, and would  also stop every once in a while to talk to the audience. He made the audience feel like he was glad to be there and was having a good time with us.   Bruno Mars' sings many types of genres, including pop, reggae, soul, R&B, and pop rock. He has many different and original songs, one about getting his money stolen to another upbeat song about being lazy. Some of his more recent songs have a few cuss words, for example his song Gorilla. He made sure to sing the songs with cuss words toward the end of the concert, when all of the younger kids would have most likely left already. He actually surprised the audience quite a bit with this. He had a fake ending; said goodnight and thank you for coming, and 5 minutes later came back out and sang some of his expletive songs.  Overall I loved this concert, and I highly recommend you go too! ",pos
Bruno Mars,"There is no doubt that Bruno Mars is one of the top male singers today. And if you haven't been to see him in concert, you're really missing out. His live performances are extremely entertaining. Many people don't realise that he's more than just a singer: his dance moves are smooth, and when he plays a drum solo, the girls cannot stop screaming! Honestly, you would think he was famous for his drum playing because he is just that good. Bruno Mars is very talented. He's also easy on the eyes ;) He's good looking and he usually wears a James Brown-type style suit which is very fitting since he dances like James Brown too. You can't help but dance along when he's performing “Runaway”, or to sing along when he's performing “Just The Way You Are”. Also, his band is perfect: when they're backing him up, there is so much energy.  He keeps it simple while giving a performance of a lifetime, no matter what the event is. Bruno Mars' live performances make me happy. I love him and I love how talented he is. He gives his performances his all, and never disappoints. When he's done, you can't help but to give him a standing ovation and beg for more. Once the concert is over, you can bet you're going to go home and listen to Bruno Mars even more. ",pos
Bruno Mars,"The Bruno Mars concert was seriously phonominal. He is such a great performer and a great singer. He's so so so good live. Him and the hooligans are amazing. They're really funny and they dance a lot and it's so good! I really think that man can do anything and pull it off. If you go to the concert you will not regret or forget it. It's so memorable and such a great time. There are lots of suprizes during the whole concert and it really keeps you on your feet. He's amazing and if he ever comes back to my city or anywhere near it I'm going to be there. He did a variety of different songs. He did reggae, his slow songs, his faster songs (like Natalie, Gorilla, etc). He even covered some songs (like bump and grind and other classics) he didn't sing the whole songs but he did the best parts of the songs he covered and mixed it together. It's very hard to explain but that was very memorable. There was singing, fire, glitter confetti, dancing, Bruno Mars and the Hooligans... What else could you want? Did you know in Honolulu Hawaii where 'Bruno' was born as 'Peter Gene Bayot Hernandez'? Hope you go to the 'Moonshine Jungle Tour because it's amazing! Have fun! ",pos
Bruno Mars,"Overall, the Bruno Mars concert was an incredible experience. The fact that he could sing like a dove, play a mean guitar lick, AND dance his pants off - all at the same time - blew me away. I was kept entertained all night long. The great thing about Bruno's set is that although it was short and focuses mostly on his most recent album, it was the most diverse set I've ever seen performed at a concert; from covers to original songs, Bruno sang pop, rock, disco, doo-wop, R&B, hip-hop, reggae, and soul, delivering every genre with the same vigor and excitement. The next best thing about the concert besides Bruno himself was his band, the Hooligans. Not only were they talented singers and performers, but also they also danced and laughed with Bruno like old buddies, making the concert seem much more like an intimate gig with friends. Basically, GO SEE HIM! You'll dance, you'll laugh, and hey, you might even cry during the ballads. So GO and find out! :) ",pos
Bruno Mars,"This concert was perhaps one of the best concerts I've been to and that says a lot since I just turned 59 and 365 days (it's still difficult for me to admit that I'm X0 years old.... I saw Jimmie Hendrix in concert, Moody Blues, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, Cream, Miranda Lambert, Lady Antebellum, Jason Aldean, Siberian Orchestra, Johnny Mathis and many many more artists and this concert ranked in the top 5. The dancing was fantastic, his stage presence and how he played with the crowd (mostly the ladies) was FUN!!!!  His drum solo-words cannot describe it... I only wish I could see him tonight in Milwaukee (I live in Wisconsin) at Summerfest tonight.  I would go again to see him....Aloe Blacc was great also!!!!! Thanks for asking. ",pos
Bruno Mars,"The Bruno Mars concert was amazing! The only fault that I would say is that there was a lot of waiting Dua Lipa was right on time and it felt like when’s Bruno coming?! Then after Dua Lipa we had to wait for them to set Bruno up which felt like forever, but when he was out there it was amazing he had fireworks and amazing dance moves and his singing was just amazing. He even added some comedy in there, and he was putting his absolute all you could see by the sweat on his body. After we thought it was over but he surprised us with an extra song :) it was an experience of a lifetime and I must say for my first concert it was A M A Z I N G ! For the merchandise I feel some of it was just a bit overpriced like the hats. ",pos
Bruno Mars,"I spent $256 on a ticket and flew from Florida to Las Vegas to see this fiasco of a show. The show was supposed to start at 9. The curtain finally rose at almost 9:30. The drums and bass were so loud, little of the vocals could be heard. The band was off several times, there was limited choreography, 2 solos (drum and piano, neither of which were Bruno, OBVIOUS TIME FILLERS), and the show lasted one hour and 15 minutes. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!!! IT SUCKED!! I am used to hearing songs sung at concerts, not stopped mid-way to laugh and joke. Bruno Mars needs to go to some REAL concerts so he can see how to please his PAYING AUDIENCE. Go get some lessons from Pink, Elton John, who ever, Bruno, cause your show is a joke!! ",neg
Bruno Mars,"It was an absolutely amazing night! The performance was stunning and the atmosphere was filled with laughter and happiness. Bruno Mars did an incredible job, by making sure everybody was having a party, and you could just see how much he loved standing on that scene and singing to the crowd. Also I am not going to forget Anderson.Paak who played just before Bruno went on stage. Andersson.Paak made sure, that everyone were ready for the big party, and he too is an incredible musician. Bruno Mars even learned how to say ""I love you"" in danish, which made us feel even closer to him. I will never forget this night! ",pos
Bruno Mars,"It was awesome!!!!! Bebe Rexha was there and Nick Jonas and who we were all waiting for BRUNO MARSSSS!!! I was soooo happy when Nick Jonas sang one of his songs from Camp Rock!!!! Bebe Rexha sang Me, Myself, and I, I love that song!!! I just think it wasn’t necessary to say some bad words while she spoke, but thats ok because it’s BEBE REXHA!!! Bruno Mars was I-N-C-R-E-D-I-B-L-E!!!!! He sang all of my favorite songssss and ne sang UPTOWN FUNK!!!! AWESOME!!!! Overall, it was the best concert of my life, even though we could have been in better seats, and I even got a souvenir t-shirt!!!! ",pos
Bruno Mars,The concert was AWESOME! The opening person was really good and did a lot with the audience. She talked to the people not as a pop star but as a person. Her song choices really set the mood and went from sad songs to happy songs and did a outstanding job. For Bruno Mars him self did super good. His back up people were an awesome addition to the show. The record thing was a really cool idea. The show was a little delayed because it didn't start until like 15 after 8. Other than that the show was awesome and set the bar very high for the people after him. love you Bruno Mars ,pos
Bruno Mars,"The show was good....not great. The tickets were pretty expensive....$200 for the nose bleed seats. The show lasted exactly one hour. I expected more. Don't get me wrong, I was entertained, but I went to see Bruno Mars because I wanted to be blown away. I wasn't. Also, the opening act was Charlie Wilson....not a fan of his so I felt like half money was wasted. When he annouched that Ciara would be opening, I was like yes!! But she didn't. That was pretty disappointing. But like I said, the show was good, but it could have been way better. ",neg
Bruno Mars,"Good things are: Saw him at the Park Theater, MonteCarlo, in Las Vegas--had great seats & my favorite venue. Love Bruno Mars, love his songs. He's a great singer, writer & producer. The energy in the venue was so alive & enjoyed it very much. Bad things were: in some songs, his voice was being drowned by the instrumental process, his guys's dance routines needed to be more in unison & his pyrotechnics sounded like M-80s at someone's back yard. OTHERWISE, loved the show! ",neu
Bruno Mars,"I could see well in the front row of the arena standing, but because of the standing I had a close contact with people around me, I never thought that I would not like the standing seat. The show was awesome. His voice was very nice, and the members were also the highest peak. It was truly a level high. It is an artist who wants to go again. Next time I would like to see a show overseas. It will be different from Japan. ",pos
Bruno Mars,"Showmanship = On Point Costumes, lighting, spectacle! - Big, bright and wonderful to look at! Vocal ability and clarity= Pitch perfect, crystal clear, simply sublime Dance and movement = A+++++ Very pleased that I made the effort to see this man and his band (came all the way from Trinidad) Only love to you and hooligans, Bruno! Only Love. P.S. Serious withdrawal symptoms on this rainy Monday!! DL ",pos
Bruno Mars,"Bruno mars is absolutely amazing.  He is the most talented artist I've ever seen in concert.  Not only can he sing, he can dance,  play guitar and drums.  His band is amazing too, they were dancing with him!  He interacted with the audience and really put on an amazing show,  rather then just lip-singing every song. His performance on stage last night was extraordinary,  and I would love to see him again. ",pos
Bruno Mars,"This is the 6th time I have seen him. The difference with this concert was that it was in an open air stadium. The lighting system and fireworks, added to the exitement. The public were good , he was well received. As usual the show was fantadtic. The repetoire of songs, the dancing and the rapport with the public. He is the greatestand I cannot eait until the next time. I hope its soon again in europe. ",pos
Bruno Mars,"Bruno as expected was amazing, other than starting 25minutes late he did not disappoint, a true entertainer. His dance sequences were spot on, he is a mix of James Brown, Prince, Morris Day and the Time. And the Hooligans were right along with him, the song would start and Hooligans would start dancing and he would seamlessly mix in and out with them. A perfect New Year Eve event would see him again. ",pos
Bruno Mars,This concert surpassed all expectations. The whole group were amazing . They all danced from the start to the finish of the concert and that took some doing while playing instruments. Bruno Mars was amazing. He has got fantastic stage presence to start with but has a startling voice. He is a very talented performer. People were on their feet for most of the concert.an exilerating experience. WOW!!! ,pos
Bruno Mars,"In a word: totally and utterly 'awesome' He's a unrivalled gifted artist, an entertainer beyond words, his whole band and crew are in a league of their own - but this tour - wow oh wow oh wow........the stage. What an incredibly show. That takes creativity, showmanship, planning beyond belief I imagine Once in a lifetime display of talent and technology. Enjoyed every single second. ",pos
Bruno Mars,"Simply put it was amazing, great, outstanding. The demographics of who attends ranges for a six year old to 80 year old grandma and grandpa's. Families, friends of all ages were in attendance. I never saw Michael Jackson, Prince, Freddie Mercury and what not in their prime, but man, I just saw Bruno Mars certainly in his and hopefully for many years to come. ",pos
Kanye West,"I gotta give it to Yeezus. He's still got the juice and for him to pack the 'Bowl' while performing a seven year old album is a testament to that fact. Show started an hour late and I had the feeling there would be some tech glitches, but you definitely couldn't hate on the effort. There was a small orchestra section stage right and on stage left what appeared to be a few DJ's and dudes on drum machines. The center of the stage featured 3 grand white staircases that were reconfigured between songs. There were fireworks at times which didn't quite fit the tone of the album, but who doesn't like fireworks. It was a party atmosphere and I felt a real connection with other fans simply based on the fact that WE LOVE THIS FUCKING ALBUM. We sang, we yelled, we danced, we laughed, and we reminisced about a Kanye that took us back to bring us forward. Most memorable moments: Staircases rotate to reveal 60 or so black men in rags and covered in dust. Very striking visual that reminded me of a slave ship. He used what I'll call ""human props"" throughout the show, but I felt like this moment resonated most. Jeezy came out for Amazing, but the tech was ALL CHEWED UP. Sound was cutting in and out, poor lighting, pianist was even confused at one point. At one point Kanye states that this performance is actually more of a dress rehearsal. I figured as much and even debated going to the Saturday show, but there was something about the rawness of an opening night that I wanted to be part of. I'm sure Saturday's show will be way more on point. ",pos
Kanye West,"I have never been a person who could pinpoint a moment in which divine providence had played some role in my life. That is, until I saw Kanye. Watching Kanye West perform is a wholly religious experience. Someone you don't know and can barely see is instructing you to complete strange actions which seem nonsensical, like throwing your hands in there or singing lyrics or pointing your middle finger to the sky. Yet, you follow along. You are surrounded by thousands of people who share similar beliefs and interests as you. Everything is ridiculous expensive and you must pay your way in. Kanye comes out pretty much an hour late, just because he can. When he finally emerges, it is on a platform suspended in the air. The platform rocks to and fro during the concert, bouncing right above the general admissions mosh pit. It is those in the mosh pit who are the most blessed. They seem positively energized by Kanye, dancing and thrashing for two hours straight. When Kanye finishes his act, he performs ""Ultralight Beam"". Towards the end of the show, his platform lowers and he steps down onto the ground, showing us that the man we had seemingly worshiped with our screams and our expressions of adulation walks on the same ground we do. And maybe it was the weed smoke, or maybe the sheer excitement, but as I was swaying to the music, I felt a connection to a higher power, something greater than myself. It was a moment of absolute perfection where I didn't feel alone and hopeless in the world. ",pos
Kanye West,"Whether his messianic stature is bona fide or self-professed, one thing’s still for certain: an evening with Kanye West will blow your freaking mind. Love him or loathe him, there are number of things we say about ‘Ye for certain. The guy boasts a repertoire of hits hotter than Seth Rogen’s motorcycle seat. This is a guy with the talent to dethrone his mentor, with the vision to produce the totally unexpected, and with the ego to say and do exactly what he wants. All in all, those ingredients synthesise to produce the greatest live music experience on offer in the modern age. Hands down. However it’s what we can’t say for certain about West that polarises crowds the world over. The rants, the fights, the Jesus lookalikes; to some extent, it’s no great surprise that the rapper has found himself at loggerheads with audiences on multiple occasions. But if that’s the price we have to pay to accept this visionary into our lives, then show me where to sign. When Kanye delivers, he arrives first class. “One of the greatest hip-hop sets of all time”, so said the Hollywood Reporter of Coachella 2011. “I am so credible and so influential and so relevant that I will change things”, so said Kanye of himself. Hear, hear, Mr. West. ",pos
Kanye West,"The sounds of hydraulic machinery filled Oracle Arena, as the stench of dirt weed mingled with the faux fog that had been pumping into the air over the past two hours. The opening samples of “Father Stretch My Hands Pt. 1” were slowed down and turned elastic, thus leaving alien chemtrails of sound in the wake of the shadowy figure tethered to the hovering spacecraft. With heads upturned in anticipation of first contact, the crowd was lost in darkness. Chants of “Kan-ye! Kan-ye!” filled every empty space, until the object of their affection shone his light down on the chosen few. The party-sized hoverboard had traversed the entire length of the arena (from a height of about 10 feet above the tallest head), before blasting spotlights on those below; instantly creating the largest circle pit a hip-hop tour has ever seen. “Just wanna feel liberated, I, I, I…” Kanye West had arrived in Oakland, and while many outside the venue failed to understand the appeal, those who had been waiting patiently (well past start time) were losing their collective mind.

Kanye West,"Kanye was a lot more humble than I expected. I've always loved a lot of the lyrics of his songs as they speak about real stuff that's going on, like the media covering up on what's actually important and people higher up trying to make everyone conform.  His concert was better than I thought it would be. He was entertaining, interactive with the crowd, tried to get the people on the floor to start a mosh pit (haha) and he talked about some shit in the media against him that wasn't true.  The massive screen thing he had happening put an interesting twist to seeing Kanye as it was done in like negative colouring and you could only half see him a lot of the time, which was a bit frustrating but also added to the drama of him. I LOVED the freaky masks he wore half the time, very Kanye- all that bling.  He played a good mix of his music from a bunch of new stuff right back to the older stuff. Almost the whole seated crowd were standing the whole time (something I've NEVER seen at a concert)  I have a newfound respect for Kanye West and am really happy I finally got to see him. I'd definitely go back ",pos
Kanye West,"it was fucking horrible as shit like really kanye? i, as well as everyone else who came to see your show in sacramento, were so hyped. it was literally going to be the highlight of my thanksgiving break. i bought your tickets for $70 as well as a shirt for $20, only for you to show up AN HOUR AND A HALF LATE, perform three songs that you didn't even finish, and to listen to your inaccurate rant about politics. honestly man, i respected you so much as an artist; you were and still are a musical genius and i will forever support your music career, but i lost all respect for you as a person yesterday. you disrespected your fans last night, who have been nothing but loyal to you throughout your career. that was a real shitty move, and to be honest with you man, i feel sorry for you. the money so up in your mind that you don't know who you are anymore. we miss the old kanye the socially woke kanye the finish the show kanye we hate the new kanye walk off the stage kanye the hella fake kanye...

Kanye West,"The Saint Pablo Tour was by far the dopest energy in one place that I have felt at a venue the size of Verizon Center.  The stage was suspended in air and the attendees with floor seats were actually a mosh pit! They stood the entire time fueling the energy as he floated above their heads and out stretched arms.  Everyone in the building stood the entire concert. Everyone.  Though the lights were dim and the big screen had an hallucination type effect, the lyrics and his movement came thru with Kanye precision. I had the time of my life at this concert. The cherry on the top was that I was invited as a surprise from my love.  The hands down best surprise I've ever received!! I love the old Kanye.  I love the new Kanye. I love Kanye. Period. ",pos
Kanye West,"Soooooo, about that concert last night... KANYE IS A BEAST! No matter how completely NUTZ he his, his talents can not be denied! The subliminal messages of his setup were incredible... *smokey, ethereal environment *floating stage that moved from END-to-END *image on screen was always in a ghostly/God-like projection *he was always looking down at his ""followers"" He's INSANE but he managed to entertain by spewing HIT AFTER HIT! I would have preferred more lighting b/c we did pay to SEE him & I wasn't really interested in his GODLY presentation. BUT, the arena was almost packed & he has another show tonight. He's #winning ",pos
Kanye West,"What can I say about probably the most talked about person in the media? This concert first off, was more of a staging experience but that definitely doesn't mean it's a bad thing at all.  In fact, Mr. West creates this unique experience that no other artist has pulled off before with the lights accompanying this man's vast array of hits that can easily move any crowd to do his bidding, overall if you ever see him town, save up what you have and experience this tour before it ends. ",pos
Kanye West,"Lit show. He's so great because he didn't need back up, the show was solely him and it was still fire. Some cool lighting but that's it. He spit fire!!! Timing: started 9:20- doors opened at 6, was supposed to start at 8. He had no opening act. Ended around 10:45. Didn't seem long enough lol No background vocals, no background dancers. A lot of of his songs played in the background with him on top. Was actually really smooth Ultralight beam finished the night which was heavenly ",neu
Kanye West,"The show was absolutely insane.  I had floor seat, which are a must for the best experience.  The lighting made the whole place seen unreal and magical...  Seeing Kanye West up close to the point where I was right under him in a mosh pit.  The forum venue is great and a perfect size in my opinion.  By far one of the best experiences of my life and for sure the best concert.  Well worth the money for floor seats and I'd pay for it all over again if I could. ",pos
Kanye West,"Had to say a really great experience seeing Kanye live. I felt the vibe that he had in his music upfront and personal then listening to his songs on the radio or through my phone. The lights and the moving stage above the people in GA was really well done. Even though it hasn't been the only concert I been to, it was probably the only one I've been to that had the stage move with Kanye on it. Pretty dope! Lots of fun! ",pos
Kanye West,"Amazing show! The greatest concert I've ever been too! The set list took something from just about every album! And his interactions with the fans was incredible. I can tell he really loved his fans, and the city (Sacramento) loved him right back! He played a little bit to long (almost thirty minutes), but that's okay. I was expecting to have long night anyway. Great job! ",pos
Kanye West,"Kanye's concert was amazing from the beginning to end! The lights and special effects were great and he got the crowd involved. He sang older songs as well as new. Half way through the show, he spoke to fans about following your dreams and never giving up, which was inspiring. Definitely an artist I would go and see live again! ",pos
Kanye West,"You can tell he doesn't like to sing his hits. He played niggas in Paris and sang about 5 words of it, while he walked around on stage. Same with all of the lights and power. Great show though. The life of pablo album felt like it was made with the show in mind. Excellent showmanship. Tons of fog, lights and lasers. ",pos
Kanye West,Couldn't have been a better show. Music was loud and bumping people were chilling having a good time and Travis Scott made the most of running throught the crowd once or twice. And over a 10/10 show the new stage idea was kinda hard to get used to but either way was really cool to see Kanye as close as he really got ,pos
Kanye West,"Amazing performance by an amazing artist, had so much fun ! Even my friend, who barely knew any of the lyrics, said she has the time of her life :) Amazing outfit, fabulous setlist and the performance was lit, couldnt stop dancing and shouting my throat and legs hurt but totally worth both the money and the pain ",pos
Kanye West,"Worse concert ever! Kanye was 1.5 hours late. Only three songs performed. One of those songs was performed twice. Then, there was 30 minutes of Kanye ranting. Then, the show was over. I am a huge fan of Kanye. This was my first and last Kanye concert.  I was very disappointed and upset. Our tickets costed $688. ",neg
Kanye West,"This was one of the best concerts I've been too, definitely in my top 5 this year. Despite the 80 min late start, he played for almost 2 hours on a floating stage. Low lights, dim, nothing but Kanye! His set was super amped, he got us all going no matter where u sat; nobody was seated. Loved it!! ",pos
U2,"What makes a U2 concert so special? What is it about a U2 show that compels us to travel hundreds and thousands of miles to see virtually the same concert over and over? A U2 show is more than just the songs in the concert. It is the feeling you get when you hear those songs. Whether they lift you up or remind you of a special time in your life, either way, the feeling you get when you hear U2 songs is euphoric. But a U2 concert is more than just those euphoric songs that are played. It is 80,000 people singing those songs together. The fact that each person at that show is feeling the exact same excitement you are. It is a sense of community and belonging. More than just the U2 concert itself, it is the whole experience. The traveling and hanging out with fellow U2 fans. The day of the U2 concert is a great time for U2 fellowship since we arrive at the stadium in the early afternoon either to line up in the GA (general admission) line or to wait for Bono, Larry, Edge and Adam to arrive. With many hours to kill before the concert begins, U2 fans share their U2 experiences, such as favorite songs, albums and concerts. My favorite U2 concert, of the 75 I have seen, was on the Elevation Tour in Providence, Rhode Island on October 31, 2001. It was my favorite U2 member's 40th birthday, drummer Larry Mullen Jr. It was the night Larry and I shared a drink. The morning of the show, I woke up outside around 8am – pretty good sleeping outside in 30 degrees for five hours. I went up to the warm hotel room until about 10am, then had some breakfast. I stayed in the GA line all day without leaving, except to take a shower around 3:30. I got everyone in the GA line to sign the big orange birthday card I made for Larry. I put my name and email address on the back just in case. The band didn’t arrive until after we were inside. Wearing our Larry Mullen Band shirts, we got our spots at the rail up front and center between Bono and Adam. I held up my birthday card for Larry as they walked on stage, but he didn’t notice it. There were many, many signs including one saying, ‘Bono let Larry sing.’ During Elevation, Bono sang, ‘ Celebration’ then said, ‘Happy Birthday.' After ""Stuck in a Moment,"" Larry’s 40th birthday celebration began. We sang ""Happy Birthday"" to Larry. A birthday cake was brought out, and Larry pretended to throw it out into the audience. Larry took the mic and came to the front to talk while Bono sat behind the drums. Larry said, ""Bono can’t play drums. It took me 40 years to get up front. I’m glad I’m spending my birthday with 18,000 of my closest friends. I feel like I could borrow money from you."" Then Bono asked for a bottle of champagne, which he shook up a la ZooTV and sprayed the audience. Edge took a swig, then Larry drank and continued to drink for the next few songs. After ""Kite,"" Larry got off the drums and made a B line for me. I got my card and shirt in hand so I could give it to him, but that’s not why he was there. He gave me the champagne bottle – with champagne still in it. I drank some and shared it with my friends. Larry wanted to share his birthday with ME! He wanted ME to have a drink on his birthday. I was SO excited I didn’t even realize they played ""Wild Honey,"" which they rarely play. After ""Pride,"" Larry came back over to me so I could give him the birthday card and Elvis tee shirt. I said, ""Thank you. Happy Birthday."" He smiled and said, ""Thank You."" Later on, Bono noticed our Larry Mullen Band shirts, shook his head and smiled. I doubt there will ever be another U2 show like that night in Providence. Granted it was Larry’s 40th Birthday, and I love Larry, but also for the rarities U2 played that night. ""Slow Dancing"" was played for the first time on the Elevation tour, and only the 11th time ever. ""Party Girl"" and ""Wild Honey"" were played for the first time on that leg of Elevation – and I’ve only heard those songs a couple of times ever. There was just a great energy in Providence that night. I still have that champagne bottle that Larry gave me on his 40th birthday. ",pos
U2,"Bom dia, Acompanho a Banda desde 1985, na época dos disco long play ou compacto e meu primeiro álbum, o primeiro disco que comprei foi ""War"". Sempre soube o posicionamento social e político do grupo, penso ser o que me chamou a atenção e cativou desde o princípio.Mas aqui no Brasil, vivemos tempos difíceis, de beligerância e intolerância de diversas formas, racial, social,religiosa. Uma sociedade apolítica, mas que fundamenta suas crenças no que a imprensa local determina. Acredito que essa é a melhor Tour em que estive, visto ser minha segunda vez num show do U2. Estive em 2006, em Vertigo e mesmo passando por um momento delicado, pois estava tomando medicação para síndrome do pânico e depressão, saí do estádio 90% melhor do que quando cheguei. A atual turnê, é de uma dos melhores, se não a melhor, assim como o álbum do grupo e se pudesse iria em todas, Setilist fantástica, iluminação e palco minimalista e remetendo a uma simplicidade do inicio dos shows da Banda. Amei!!!!Parabéns e que venham muito mais........ ............................................... Good Morning, I accompany the band since 1985, in the days of long or compact disc and my first album, the first record I bought was ""War"". I have always known the social and political position of the group, I think it is what caught my attention and captivated me from the beginning. But here in Brazil, we live in difficult times, of belligerence and intolerance of diverse forms, racial, social, and religious. An apolitical society, but that bases its beliefs on what the local press determines. I think this is the best Tour I've been on, seeing it as my second time at a U2 show. I was in Vertigo in 2006 and even going through a delicate time, since I was taking medication for panic syndrome and depression, I left the stadium 90% better than when I arrived. The current tour is one of the best, if not the best, as well as the group's album and if it could go in all, fantastic Setilist, minimalist lighting and stage and referring to a simplicity of the beginning of the bands shows. Congratulations and many more ........ ",pos
U2,"Great show, very basic staging, which is a nice change of pace for U2 recently. It allowed you to focus on them as a band, 4 guys playing music together. As a tour kick off, there will be some glitches and bugs, the worst of which is when The band and Bono totally flubbed the entire song With or Without You!!! The band was out of sync right from the start and that must have rattled Bono because he false started the first verse, got the lyrics wrong, then just stood there silent while the crowd sort of tried to chime in with the vocals. It was actually pretty awkward, and Bono didn't acknowledge it except by saying ""you guys can sing this one"". It was so great to see them actually play Joshua Tree straight through, track by track. I wasn't sure that's how it would really play out. As an album about the greatness, and hardships, of America, with inspiration from American music, landscapes, and especially politics, there was no way to get through the set without nods (mostly subtle - for U2) to the current leadership in America. The opening 8-9 songs before actually launching into Joshua Tree were pretty telling about the bands politics and values of freedom, truth, and fulfilling the American dream. The fact that opening night coincidentally fell on the 60th anniversary of the Martin Luther King ""Give Us the Vote"" speech gave more weight to lyrics referencing King's assassination in ""Pride (In the Name of Love)"". Finally, totally unrelated to Songkick or U2, but I have to say how HORRIBLE Levi's Stadium is and the whole process of getting there (unmanaged traffic), getting into the venue (no purses bigger than a cell phone allowed and no mention of that fact anywhere), getting food (seemed like only 25 people trying to sell hot dogs to 50,000!). Will never see another show there again no matter who the act is. ",pos
U2,"This show needed to start and finish in darkness to concentrate the mind on the amazing imagery and truly iconic music. The lead in through tracks from Unforgettable Fire set the pace and raised the pulse rate to a crescendo at the onset of Where The Streets Have No Name where it remained at rates which would have set off many a hospital vital signs alarm until the end of the a play through of the entire Joshua Tree album. Had this concert finished there it would have sad to depart - and U2 knew this so included a further array of some of their finest tracks from the last 30 years. This was the trickiest period of the gig however, as not all of the next 35 - 40 minutes could match the standard set down by some of the best music of the 20th century. Moments of oddness crept in, as is Bono's way, and momentum was lost - not gained - towards the end. Ultimately, an incredible visionary onslaught and a truly mammoth rendition of One lifted the gig back to the heights of its earlier euphoria. This could easily have been the best concert I have ever seen, but on balance it dropped short. I would not have missed this for the world and I am sure I will look back in years to come and feel so pleased that I was there and saw what was a true moment in musical history. As it stands right now I have a mixed emotion... but there is no denying that of the many hundreds of concerts I have been to in the last 40 years this was right up there at the very pinnacle - a top ten bucket list moment. ",neu
U2,"U2 at Arrowhead Stadium in KC was a musical memory I'll put in my Top 10...so far.  We got parking lot passes from Ticketmaster beforehand to  save $$ & make navigating the throngs of traffic manageble.  We got to the lot about 5:30 p.m.  People had been there tailgating & the lot attendants were very organized, flagging us in to our spot. We immediately headed in to the Stadium so we could check out the U2 merchandise.  Entering was a breeze, even with security, because we had checked online to see what could or couldn't be taken into the Stadium.  The restrictions make lines move much quicker, even with entering through metal detectors.  Walking up the ramp to our seat level was easy.  U2 had merchandise areas set up at more locations, so lines there were less.  The concession places had very friendly attendants.  The stadium seats were very comfortable.  Security was there in abundance & were also helpful & friendly.  Concert acoustics for an open stadium were amazing.  The only downside was the placement of the audio towers or whatever they were, but they were necessary to provide the incredible U2 audio & visual experience.  After the concert, we waited for an hour on purpose before exiting to avoid sitting in traffic, idling.  Again, smooth exit.  So I highly recommend seeing U2 for their musical talent, their political message & celebrating the 4th anniversary of the Joshua Tree album.  ENJOY! ",pos
U2,"U2 are a band who have conquered the globe and are considered iconic by fans of most genres. With such staggering reputation it is obviously quite difficult to form a live show of equal stature. Luckily, Bono and co obtain a form of bravado that is required of any iconic band. The key component of their gigs is that they understand how important and dear the audience hold tracks such as 'With Or Without You' and the intense sincerity in which they perform could not be more appropriate. There is an ethereal state when thousands upon thousands are singing along to 'The Streets Have No Name' whilst four musicians command the entire crowd. There is no denying Bono performs with the same level of self-assuredness that he conducts himself in daily life yet when the opening bars of 'Pride' begin, this level of bombast is required to tackle these gargantuan anthems. They have an impossible amount of hits to choose from, yet the setlist feels well calculated and not simply a 'greatest hits' compilation. The use of snippets of their own music and classics by the likes of Bowie turned their gig from a concert into a musical celebration. ",pos
U2,"The concert was awesome but the venue was absolute crap!!!!! Paid $264.00 x 2 & a tower was blocking the view depending where the band was standing on the stage. So view blocked. Support act Noel Gallagher couldn’t hear him speak, don’t know what he was saying & sound not too good at all. U2 came on & could hardly see them. GA would have been better & cheaper & from what Ive heard, they had the best place to hear. SCG is not a good venue for a concert & we were so totally disappointed with what we paid, seating & going to ground & trying so squeeze through the line ups for toilets & good to get to the Merchandise shop. Then trying to get back up to level 5. Please never put a concert there again, unless you our stage in centre, so everyone can see. You shouldn’t charge extreme prices for crap seating. U2 was awesome as always but couldn’t always see them & at times hear them, the sound got better as the night went on. Definitely very disappointed with SCG ",neu
U2,"Amazing concert as always. Lot of security at the entrances so it was a little bit slow everything and I was afraid because maybe I couldn't watch Noel Gallagher but organization was clever and started one hour later more or less. Really it was very difficult to be there at 19 with that security level. But everything was perfect. Noel played lot of Oasis songs with classics like Wonderwall, Little by Little or Don't Look Back in Anger. Then with less than 20 minutes delay, U2 came on stage. Larry Mullen started alone in the middle of the scenario situated at the center of the stadium and it all began... Thanks for allow us to remember a great album like Joshua Tree! All the songs in order, side A and side B if you like more the vinyl. And the last part... Amazing with songs like Elevation or Vertigo. And one last surprise... We could listen a new song from the upcoming album, Songs of Experience. No more to say: GREAT AS ALWAYS U2. We love you! ",pos
U2,"Best concert I've ever seen and probably will ever see save for another U2 show. No seat was a bad seat as they had a massive 'screen' that spanned roughly half the length and a third of the height of MSG. The screen could be lowered and raised and there was a catwalk inside of it as well as under it on the floor for the band members to move around on. Animations and live videos of the band members playing were projected onto the screen and could be interacted with inside of the screen. I've never seen anything like it. They had a great mix of classic U2 songs and new ones all while using mixed media to create much more than a music concert. This was a retrospective art show, film screening, advocacy platform, etc. A final treat was Bruce Springsteen coming on near the end of the show trading mics with Bono to sing Where the Streets Have No Name. You have got to see this band live. ",pos
U2,"U2 is a big part of the history of rock and roll, and music in general. They always have been since I have memory. Their Montreal concert on June 5 did not fall short from other performances over the years. They opened in a simple yet intense manner with three songs from their latest album. They followed with I Will Follow and Gloria, which are of course songs featured in Boy and Gloria, their first two studio albums. They followed with a mix of classic songs with songs from Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience. The show is truly enjoyable even though it lacks classics like With or Without You, Mysterious Ways or New Year's Day. It was a great experience (no pun intended), and I really looking forward to attending another concert soon. ",pos
U2,U2 are a mega band and with that they have quite a few critics But these shows were the perfect reply to their critics this was a masterpiece of stadium gigging The focus was a celebration of their monster album The Joshua Tree... the album that broke America. Tonight was a celebration and nostalgia trip. The sound was crystal clear and brilliantly stage set Behind a simple stage set was an immense TV screen which beamed out superb videos The crowd were on top form The irony was ending with Noel Gallagher playing together Don't Look Back in Anger which the crowd gladly sang as we left Twickenham I nearly missed this and so glad I didn't Down the Front ,pos
U2,"Over the years I never missed a U2 tour concert (and I've seen many several times). I believe this one belongs to my personal top-5. Not only because of the awesome Anton Corbijn made movies, but moreover because of the extremely well played songs. A big compliment for that to all 4, they were all great! But specially for Bono who's voice was superb. In acoustics the Amsterdam Arena is normally a poor venue. But on Sunday, the evening that I was there, the sound was perfect. What else is there to wish in the future? Apart from good healthiness I would say, a nice 10-15.000 spectator venue, without cell phones in the audience, no video walls, but just the U2 music... ",pos
U2,"The O2 arena was a new experience for me.  I'd previously seen U2 only in outdoor stadiums in Auckland and Wellington, New Zealand.  The stage was amazing - I've no idea how they could do that outdoor. It was great to hear songs from the new album - greatest hits concerts are for bands past their prime - and they sounded so very good. Still its not a U2 concert without some of the old stuff and my personal favourite With or Without You was a highlight for me. Patti Smith was a real surprise and she fitted in perfectly. What a great way to open an close. U2 are also always innovating to stay fresh and this concert was no exception.  See you in NZ boys ",pos
U2,U2 was pretty good if quite formulaic (exactly the same show as 90% of the rest of th I+E Tour). I think they are best when they are lined up in rock-n-roll T formation (Bono in front of Larry with Edge out left and Adam on the right). They used this for Beautiful Day and it was a truly great rock-n-roll moment. Like seeing them rehearsing in Bono's garage on Cedarwood Road...my other favorites were Every Breaking Wave (acoustic) with the Edge on piano and Bono singing and the closer before the encore: With or Without You. I was quite disappointed that this particular show was shorter than all the other ones in this tour. ,neu
U2,"Super concert, très bonne ambiance, le show était là avec une super mise en scène qui était bien en lien avec les musiques jouées. Le groupe est vraiment très actif sur scène ce qui rendait le concert d'autant plus vivant. Le seul point négatif était, selon moi, la première partie, Noel gallagher n'était pas très entraînant, contrairement à nos attentes car Oasis est un groupe que j'adore mais là, la partie de Noel était un peu décevante, dommage. Dans tous les cas le concert de U2 est un concert à ne pas raté si vous aimez le groupe car il vaut largement le détour ! ",pos
U2,"It was the best concert I've ever gone to. Edge was amazing with his guitar solos and piano riffs, While Bono energizing the crowd with constant dancing and all of his antics including dancing with a random girl from The crowd. Larry was an absolute monster on the drums, he looks great for his age and he kept smashing the kit with all of his might for 2 hours. Adam looked awesome while he kept the rythm and held his classic Clayton pose and stance while playing a mean bass. The films and light shows were Fantastic as well, and I am impressed with the quality of the shirt I purchased. ",pos
U2,"The audio was amazing, the sound was probably one of the best concerts I've attended. Visually it was bad.  Most of the performance was blocked by the Giants screen in the middle of the stage. If you were seated on the sides of the bowl, your experience was probably fine. However, if you were seated on either end of the Garden, you missed the MAJORITY of the show. Very disappointed that when I bought the tickets there was no disclaimer that the entire show would have an obstructed view. I could only see the band 25% of the time, which is a very bad percentage for a venue like MSG.... ",neu
U2,"I have been following and attending U2 live concerts for almost 30 years, and I was a bit doubtful about this tour - the 2015 Innnonce tour didn't give me great emotions. ....how much wrong I was!!!! The live was great, the band powerful, the set-list was balanced and - even if I would have made some changes - it was very good. Attending from the parterre gave me the possibility to walk around the stage, from one side to the other of the venue,seeing the band on the main stage, on the acoustic stage and on the bridge. Great, see them again in Dublin in a few days! ",pos
Adele,"We visited Adèle. Not at her home, but in the Ziggodome. Recently she is no longer as a house sparrow as she used to be. We were quite nervous beforehand, because we had never been to her before. Completely for free, of course, because as soon as you sit together it is very nice. In fact, it was so much fun that a sense of deprivation now prevails and the realization that such an experience is now far away. Adele in Ziggodome 06-06-2016 (59) Yes, it was great what Adèle did. It was the last concert in a row of 4, so we read both positive and negative things. And believe me all negative comments are nagging, that is searching. It was almost perfect, only during 1 song on the middle stage the basses started to pile up, causing an annoying rumbling to drown out the rest of the music every now and then. Only 1 song was not perfect sound wise. But that's all. Adele in Ziggodome 06-06-2016 (58) The music of Radiohead or Pink Floyd cannot be compared to that of Adèle. As an artist she is of the same order of magnitude. Just a few weeks ago, Radiohead was a memorable concert at the HMH and now another intense experience has been added. Not in the traditional sense of a pop concert, but in the unique variant that Adèle has made of it. A kind of living room as a stage for her voice. (Ultimately, the living room is the best place to really listen to music in all the details.) Adèle has a glorious voice, a voice that can touch you deeply. Along with an accompaniment that perfectly complements her voice. The man behind the sound has also achieved a great result in that regard. The band / accompaniment orchestra was present, but Adèle remained in the foreground in a very nice mix. Live, but in the detail of the sound the experience of a studio recording. Everything revolves around Adèle's music, where her voice occupies such an important place. One thought during the concert was, ""This woman has everything."" The voice, the ability to write beautiful music. The environment to make this a beautiful product. The team to make a live performance a sensation. The finesse to it unforgettable. Adele in Ziggodome 06-06-2016 (45) Confetti with handwritten messages from Adèle! Who thinks about it and who also carries it out: Adèle and her team. She only has a big ass, as she herself shouted in her English language during the ""selfie session"" to the public, but even that is debatable whether that is a downside. Not to mention a family and a family life. She just goes into bicycles with her son Amsterdam. Adele in Ziggodome 06-06-2016 (5) Most important of all, she lets us enjoy her talents. Some people find the chatter between songs annoying, I personally find it a very nice personal way to put each song on a pedestal. That singing alone cannot remain fascinating in itself is compensated for by an extra stage. There ""Set Fire To The Rain"" was even provided with a real rain Adele in Ziggodome 06-06-2016 (64) curtain around her. Wonderful, I admit that I have a thing for water, but still. The effort is being made to make this happen. That she took ample time for a ""selfie session"" with the audience around her, I just find it amusing and enjoy her humor in commenting on her posing postures. If only we had stood there, and could also take a selfie. Adele in Ziggodome 06-06-2016 (63) Also on the setlist you can only say that it is never enough. The opener ""Hello"" was self-evident and immediately short-circuited everything involved in feeling in my body. A kind of joy that I cramp during the following songs slowly recovered until ""Water Under The Bridge"" caused another ""suffocation"". It is strange to me that ""Skyfall"" fell from the sky with an attack on the control. More beautiful than ever. ""Make You Feel My Love"" remains special as a cover, also a tribute to Bob Dylan. That way I can say something about almost all the following songs. That would be too much. At a certain point Adèle announced the end of the evening, causing a slight panic over me. Shit, time has gone fast! Have I absorbed and experienced everything well Adele in Ziggodome 06-06-2016 (71) enough? Nonsense of course, but reason to suck in the rest of the evening and experience every moment. Also looking around me to see if this is being recorded on video. I couldn't discover it, but as far as I am concerned it is a must. I want to see and hear this again. What a beautiful evening!

Adele,"The journey from the center of the arena to the main stage was lit by camera phones and shrieks of joy. Once there, “Hello” transitioned into “Hometown Glory”. London landmarks gave way to the Denver skyline, as the lyrics changed from ‘my hometown’ to ‘your hometown.’ What could have come across as gimmicky at some mainstream country show, somehow rang true as an honest tribute to the city in which Adele was an honored guest. The cynic in me didn’t want to show any emotion, but there was something so enchanting about the way she sang “the wonders of my world”, while images of the Rocky Mountains towered above her, that I just couldn’t help myself. It had been less than ten minutes since she had first appeared and I was already powerless against her charm. “How many of you did not want to come tonight?” (only someone with extreme self-confidence would ask that question, so when a few men confirmed, she had the perfect response.) “Thank you for being a good sport and making my show sold out.” Speaking as one of those people who don’t listen to Adele’s music on a regular basis, my biggest complaint is the lack of variation across her songs. There is no denying that voice of hers, but I feel like her albums are very vanilla. I do believe her lack of range is by design though. Keeping it safe is what has allowed her to appeal to so many, while offending so few. Last night didn’t exactly change my mind when it came to her songs, but her tremendous personality and sense of humor provided a depth that I wasn’t aware of before. She could have performed the entire concert solo and I would have been entertained. The fact that the screen eventually dropped after “One and Only”, exposing twenty musicians, including a whole crew of extraordinary backup singers, just added to the spectacle. “My music isn’t that much fun…I hope you knew that. I do have a couple upbeat ones… let’s get them out of the way, so we can cry.” Self-confidence gave way to self-awareness as the crowd came alive for “Rumour Has It” — one of the few songs you could actually dance to. There was a very classic feel to the presentation. The stage was framed in solid light, while Adele’s image projected in black-and-white like some movie star from the 50’s. The stellar band was separated into strings, percussion, and voice; all indispensable to each composition, but also completely anonymous and respectful of who they were there to serve. For a diva, Adele was surprisingly approachable as well. When she asked questions, she made it a point to listen to the answers coming from the front rows. There was a dialogue between her and her fans. When she saw a guy in a purple shirt, passionately singing along, she invited him and his friends on stage to take a selfie.

Adele,"It is hard to know what to say that hasn't already been said, the list of superlatives has been done and each one is accurate. Adele may be nervous performing live, and there are times where that shows through, but somehow the fact that, arguably, the worlds finest singer shows a vulnerability adds to the performance especially when combined with her self deprecating honesty. The attention to detail is clear, the fact that she thanks the guy who delivers 'hot honey' by name, thanks the guys who surround the stage during Skyfall and says 'see you all Saturday' shows that she is no Prima Donna artiste, Somehow through a meteoric rise, through all the fame and fortune she still retains that ordinary north London girl wanting to entertain her audience and entertain she does, in spades! The T Shirts personally signed fired into the crowd, the note left on the back of someone's seat all these acts of kindness make someone's night unforgettable. However, all of the humour, beautiful touches and adept performance are totally dominated by that voice, that wonderful, utterly unmistakable, beautiful voice which towered over Wembley Stadium and owned the evening. The songs are expertly crafted works of art in their own right and I love them all but if she sang the phone book I would pay to listen. The highlights for me are predictable, Hello, Skyfall, Feel my Love, Set Fire to the Rain and Someone Like You, all of which were belted out by 100,000 people, these are the spine tingling moments you experience rarely in life. The one song I would still love to hear live is River Lea, lyrically brilliant and one of my all time favourite songs. If you have never seen Adele perform live you really do need to and this may be your last chance, although I cannot tell you how much I hope it is not! ",pos
Adele,"Having seen Adele previously at the Hammersmith Apollo a few years ago we really wanted to get tickets again, my wife tried for many hours to get tickets for her last tour and when this 4 night tour went on sale she tried again we were successful getting tickets for the Wednesday night, the only problem was she had no choice but to buy the drinking package at £249 each but because we wanted to see her we had no choice but to buy them.  We had had an email form Songkick advising us to arrive early for security check which was understandable in the light of recent events, the line to enter was building up when we arrived at 4.30 pm, everyone was waiting for the 5pm opening, 5pm passed and everyone were patient but they did not start letting people in until around 5.20 pm.  Eventually we were let in to the Bobby Moore suite to start the evening with a drink, the food choice for the suite was very limited, sushi, salad or hot dog (which were not hot at all), we enjoyed a few glasses of wine before we entered the stadium.  Once we got to our seats for the start of the show is when we realised that if we wanted to see anything we should have taken binoculars even though we were only on the second tier to be honest Adele was a dot on the stage.  Adele performance was amazing and once again she meet our every expectations she has an brilliant voice and is so down to earth.  Paying that kind of money to see her show was worth it just to experience her voice and music, but paying that kind of money for the entry to the Bobbie Moore suite (which was just a function room) was really over priced.  We had a fantastic time listening to Adele but the before part was a total waste of money. ",neu
Adele,"Few artists have enjoyed the success over the course of a career spanning several decades that Adele has achieved over the past few years. Escaping the curse of that dreaded second album, ‘21’ propelled Adele into superstardom faster than anyone could have predicted and has broken probably every record that was there to be broken. Seeing Adele live at the Royal Albert Hall back in 2011 was a really special moment. Clearly overwhelmed by the whirlwind success of the album, she took to the stage with a vulnerability that made her instantly likeable and relatable, whilst still delivering a class A performance. Chatting to the audience like they were all friends and wanting them to feel like they were watching the gig ‘in their living rooms’, the most special moment of the evening came when the every single member of the 5000 strong audience belted the lyrics to hit single ‘Someone Like You’, leaving a speechless Adele visibly emotional and barely a dry eye in the house. No big production or special effects were needed, as the beauty of the live arrangements and of those lyrics that made ‘21’ the masterpiece that it is, were enough. Having publicly admitted that she suffers with severe stage fright, it is probable that we will not witness Adele touring arenas or stadiums. I believe this to be a good thing, as the beauty of her live show could not be appreciated in such big surroundings.  Just make sure your one of the few who gets a ticket. ",pos
Adele,"I was waiting ages and hoping Adele would announce a new tour since the 21 tour that i missed for being minutes slow for the tickets. As the 25 tour was announced my only goal was to get those tickets at any cost! Everything seemed go bad from the start as the page for the ticket pre-sale did not work for me. I had no choice but to divert to viagogo and pay my ass off for two tickets - all my savings were lost... BUT - it definitely WAS WORTH EVERY DIME! After few hours driving, overnight trip by ship and frustrating times getting to the concert area - We finally really were there. I did not know what to expect from the show. But what ever it would be, i knew i would love just to see and hear her sing live. As the show kicked off the feeling was just phenomenal - the emotion was to be hand felt. The show was not rockets, pyros and any fancy stuff... just Adele and smooth graphics and wisely chosen video backgrounds. But what else would it even need - nothing! Because... Adele! The show kept the audience in it's embrace the whole set. It even made the bond to the audience deeper as she really got involved in person with some of us. She asked a couple fans up on stage and even sang a duet with one! Anyways - will recommend to go see and hear her live to everyone! Adele is my number one female artist and i would not have missed her live tour again - and am really happy i did not. Go, see, hear and love Adele! ",pos
Adele,"First, I must say, that show was AMAZING!!!The black & white screen matches her music style perfectly, including the videos playing on. Let's talk about Adele and her performance.She's a talented singer over the world, of course. Not only she can write and sing such good songs as Hello, When we were young, Send my love, etc., but also she's able to control the live show very well.Her voice, stage style, funny small talk between songs, even the eye contact with each audiences, proves that she can hold this grand show all by herself! That is a two-hour performance without any silence break, except for 3 minutes underground walk from central stage to main stage. It's unbelievable since almost all songs she sang were highly difficult! She is a kind and responsible singer, also. No matter where you are, you can receive her beautiful smile and shining eyesight during the concert. She can even play jokes nearby the crowd! That must be everybody's good memory! Her humors and straightly personal characters make her so closed with fans. After each song, you may just treat her as a good friend when she talking! As a VIP, I do think it's valuable to have such good musical listening and watching experience, except for the seat, which is not good enough for a VIP. However, that should be the problem of the hall's condition. I must say, you should go for at least one Adele's concert in your life! ",pos
Adele,"Our family of 4 daughters, my husband and myself saw Adele on 10/03/17, her first Sydney show. We have loved Adele since we listened to her first album in 2010. As soon as we heard she was coming we knew we had to be there. Even though we were seated  very far away from the stage Adele made everyone of the 950000 crowd feel like we were all much closer. Every moment was fantastic, Adele's phenomenal voice, the amazing video footage of Adele's eyes opening as the show started to the final song of Someone Like You, where the sound of the huge crowd singing in unison with Adele was unlike anything I have ever heard. The circular stage setup was amazing, giving everyone access to seeing Adele. Adele walked the circle giving every part of the stadium a chance to see her. The video footage that played with the songs was beautiful and ensured you kept your eyes on the stage. The set list was a wonderful collection of Adele's 3 albums. Her interaction with the audience was funny, sincere and she really made us feel like we were right there with her. I think when you see your daughters crying with the emotion of getting to see Adele live and then more crying because it was even better than you could of dreamed, speaks volumes. I would see her again in a heartbeat if I could and would say to anyone if you can go then do it! ",pos
Adele,"I attended her concert in the biggest venue here in Oslo, Norway – Telenor Arena. It is perhaps mostly known for its lack of acoustic quality. The room is simply put way too big and sterile for that. Nevertheless; The Adele Tour team actually pulled it off this time though, and were able to fill the «dead» space in a more that satisfying manner. Now, enough said about the venue. To the music: Being the big fan that I am it would be hard to hide my subjective judgement of the performance and music presented by Adele. But with that said I think it is fair to say that she, as a performer, is one of the best there is in the world today. She gives a lot of herself to the audience and often includes random attendees in the most spontaneous ways. Music wise there is almost nothing to say other than that it is absolutely outstanding. Adele brings such a huge presence with her voice, unlike anyone else in the industry. Even the less “complicated” songs become big and overwhelmingly magnificent. All in all, you get the feeling that Adele knows how it is to be “on the other side” (had to write that) and therefore she isn’t afraid of posing for a selfie or giving out large amounts of waves to the crowd. There is no doubt that Adele forever will be remembered as one of the greatest artist of our century. ",pos
Adele,"The show was a dream come true. Adele is beautiful, charming, kind, warm, and breathtaking. I sincerely can't say enough about her. Her voice was crisp and clear and 100x better than the studio version and I can't believe that's even possible. She created such a personable and intimate experience in an arena by interacting with the audience and carrying conversations with us. She'd stop nearly after every song to chat with us about the song, her thought process when writing it, her feelings and experiences when the song came out, etc. It was like being at a release party and I loved it! It was like she was an old friend who felt like home. She had two stages, one at the front and one in the back to be closer to those sitting far away. She had a large screen spanning across the front stage so that you could get good video feeds of her performance, which was refreshing as the last few concerts I've been to didn't consider the people sitting in the back. Seeing the artist perform live and listening to them live are all part of the concert experience and seeing them is a large enhancement. She even had her own rain room and her band was fantastic. Seriously. I would go again and again and again. I love Adele. She's genuine, humble, and her voice is one-of-a-kind. I'm blessed to have her as part of our generation. ",pos
Adele,"I am not going to review the show, as this has been done by thousands of others. What I will review is the package that I paid for. This was a birthday present for my wife. So as a special event I decided to make it special by getting the Premium Seat & Exclusive Merchandise Package. This package got you the following: .Reserved seat in a premium location - YES WE GOT RESERVED SEATS BUT SPOILT BY HAVING A CAMERA GANTRY WHICH BLOCKED OUR VIEW WHEN ADELE WALKED TO THE FRONT OF THE STAGE. IN HINDSIGHT WE WOULD HAVE HAD A BETTER VIEW HAD WE JUST BOUGHT STANDING TICKETS. .Limited edition screen print .Limited edition tote bag .Adele Live 2017 tour programme – WE WERE TOLD ON COLLECTION OF OUR MERCHANDISE THAT THE TOUR PROGRAMME WAS NOT INCLUDED AS THE ONES THEY HAD WERE FROM THE AUSTRALIA/NEW ZEALAND LEG OF THE TOUR??? SORRY....WAS THIS WEMBLEY EVENT A LAST MINUTE THROWN TOGETHER THING. PISS POOR, PISS POOR. .Limited edition show laminate and lanyard .Limited edition commemorative ticket All in all Adele was brilliant and my wife loved it. But I felt I had let her down as I had promised her good seats and we got good seats WITH A RESTRICTED VIEW. The moral of the story is “all that glistens might not be gold”. ",neg
Adele,"Not worth seeing in a large venue like Madison Square Garden. She's a huge star so it makes sense that she plays the amount of seats she can sell out for (gotta make them $$), but the music type and quality is just not suited to this kind of setting. Beacon Theater would be a great spot to watch her perform since she's not much of a performer beyond the superhuman voice. It's an intimate experience that's bastardized by having her sing in a voluminous atmosphere. Her music relies too heavily on the slow-tempo ballads, and for that reason she doesn't have the energy to excite a crowd of 20,000 people. She should really consider this when moving on to her fourth album. More upbeat standards in the style of Amy Winehouse would be awesome stuff for her. Because let's face it, listening to Adele when you're alone manifesting sorrow = perfect mood setting. Watching Adele manifesting sorrow = sadness, boredom, and general displeasure. I can't believe I PAID to have someone depress me. On my BIRTHDAY no less. Oh well, she does make up for it by being generally goofy and funny, talking to the audience intermittently - something that takes me full circle to my point - something that would be better appreciated in a smaller venue. ",neg
Adele,"I went to see Adele at the 1th of June 2016 in the Ziggodome in Amsterdam. I'm a big fan of her since day one. 19, 21 and now 25 and she is still getting better! I already bought tickets in december'15 so i waited for nearly 7 months until it finally took place. I red some reviews from her concert in London and they were all terrific, so now i was even more excited! When i entered the Ziggodome the first thing i saw were these amazing closed eyes of Adele on the screen. And then the moment the show starts.. This blew my mind!! Here eyes on the screen openend and Adele came on stage starting with Hello. She did all here top songs from every album like Hometown Glory, Someone Like You and When We Were Young. The whole two hours i obessively watched this woman singing and chatting. She talks about her songs, laughed with these hilarious giggles and making jokes and selfies with fans. I stood there with goosebumps, tears in my eyes and this amazing good feeling. I honestly never heard anyone live with such a clear voice as Adele!! Her band was amazing too! When you think you can't love Adele more then you already did... go to this concert;) This was the best concert ever!! Nothing but love from Holland X ",pos
Adele,"This review is dealing with concert entry.  I purchased my tickets and had to pick them up at the arena the night of the concert.  The doors were supposed to open at 6:00.  They did not open until 6:40.  We got into a very long line at 6:40.  People in line were very upset, because, after an hour, we were still not anywhere close to the arena to get in due to the length of the line. The concert was supposed to start at 7:30, but did not start until about 8:00.  After almost 90 minutes in line, we walked in the door as Adele was singing her blockbuster hit, ""Hello"".  We were unable to get to our seat until mid-way through the second song. After working so hard to secure tickets, showing up in plenty of time, and still missing part of the concert?  This is unacceptable.  When I questioned the United Center personnel, they said this choice of how this was run was due to Adele's concert management's choice versus United Center policies. Adele's management needs to examine their policies, change how they manage events and realize they have many, many frustrated and disappointed fans who did not get to fully experience what should have been a phenomenal event. ",neg
Adele,"I thought the show was amazing. I got the tickets through the pre-sale. Even though I was quite disappointed in the seat selection I was able to get through the pre-sale when I logged into the site at the exact time the pre-sale started for her Monday night show in Chicago, they ended up being okay for nose-bleeds. We were right in front of her and her main screen. Adele has always been my favorite and a role model and as soon as she came out, I started crying and could not stop until a song and a half later. At the end of the day, I can say I was at least in the same room as her even though I was more than willing to pay a lot more money to see her/be closer to her. Lastly, I've never been to the United Center before, so that was neat. People have told me that their sound quality there isn't that good and I only experienced that when she talked in between her pieces. I wished they were able to get her a different mic or turn up the volume on it immensely because I was not able to hear in some parts as well as my mother. Nothing on her because she has such great talent, a voice, and is such a doll. I hope she tours again because I will definitely go! ",neu
Adele,"The visual effects, stage management, Adele interaction and story telling was all brilliant..... BUT the supplied sound system was absolutely awful and totally inadequate for the application.  The sound was diabolical, useless, distorted and completely drowned by the obtrusive bass from the drums. I have never endured such a rubbish sound system; I have always walked out!  The only singing I got to hear at all was Adele's ballads where there was NO baseline at all.  However the reverberation could now be clearly heard. A centrally located sound source in a predominately concrete round structure is bound to fail with so many reflecting surfaces.  Was the obnoxious bass levels designed to swamp the reverb? Value for money; never. If there is a class action against Wembley Stadium I will be signing as a refund will be demanded. Poor Adele, she does not deserve such treatment and could not have been offered a solution. Regards Angus McClare ",neg
Adele,"The. Best. Night. Of. My. Entire. Life. This was the second time for me to see Adele. Last time I was quite high up, this time I was in Golden Circle. The atmosphere was incredible, Adele made me feel like I was the only one there in a packed out stadium. The banter she has with her audience in hilarious, she includes everyone and t feels like you're hanging out with your best mate you've known for years. As for her songs, the emotion and passion she sings with is just so raw and heart warming, I cried so many tears. You can tell she has an absolute ball on stage and she has so many upbeat songs and the sass she has is unreal- it cracks me up every time! I feel so grateful to have been apart of this tour and so happy that Adele decided to share this experience with every single one of us. I hope she has the most relaxing break with her family and hope she knows we'll always be here for her whenever/ if she decides to come back. Xx ",pos
Adele,"Adele was freaking amazing Big love 4 her. But i had the vip tickets ive payed 250€ for the show. The doors was supposed to be open at 6.30 , it was 6 and i was outside the door waiting to open , in the rain , the vip people didnt let me in , they said no its not time yet we were wet , there was no shed .My sister had a regular ticket 121€ en she was earlier inside then me , while i payed 250€ for early entrance . And a friend payed 121€ en his seats was even better then mine in the concert hall in antwerp . Adele has called him even on stage . Because he had a good place better then the vip ticket what ive got. I was seated on the side from the stage 3 row and that friend of mine without vip had a seat infront of the stage 1st row . Im not a complainer but this was not correct , its a lot of money i payded . Just wanted to say this , its to bad But adele is great , best concert ive ever seened ",neu
Adele,"His eyes were opened with the greatest punctuality ever seen in the Palau Sant Jordi, at least seen by a server. A meticulous show and attention to detail. Adele is a soloist and is characterized by little dynamic themes, however, that concert was anything but boring, she is a born comedian and she never ceased to amaze us. She is tender as the mother she is now, and at the same time a scoundrel. The sobriety of the stage, the quality of the audiovisual, and the coherence made this show the most elegant known. I would have paid to enjoy it like those who were sitting on the dance floor did, to see her up close and dance to her ballads. A bittersweet show, I am happy to have been there, but sad because it is over and it is only part of our memory, for that reason, I suppose, I will continue listening to ""When We Were Young"" and I will remember that May night with much affection .",pos
Beyoncé,"There is no artist now that is comparable to Beyoncé. She stands by herself above all other entertainers, as a singular force she is Queen Bey and yes I am a huge Beyoncé fan. I've liked her music but Lemonade is an amazing album, touching on different musical genres, and my anthem is Formation so I had to see Beyoncé for the Formation World Tour. Large arenas are so cumbersome but I bared through it, drove 3.5 hours, waited in line, parked near (but not really) sat down and within 15 minutes it started. I must say considering everything, the show started on time. The moment I heard that distinctive beat for Formation and saw Beyoncé and her dancers come out, I LOST MY MIND (I was just screaming and jumping with no real aim but to release all my energy). I was in the same space as Beyoncé and it was a lot of screaming. Much like those videos of girls loosing their mind over Elvis, the Beatles, and Justin Bieber- I was doing that and it was fantastic. Because collectively the entire audience was also LOOSING THEIR MINDS. Just that experience like communal euphoria it's very hard to get but damn it if it doesn't make you feel magical. The stage had a giant cube and screens and I could definitely see a little figure (I didn't have the best seats) who happened to be Beyoncé. Before she begins, she asked as questions and if we agreed we had to respond with ""I Slay"" I didn't so much say it as screamed it at the top of my lungs like my life depend on it. GOD DAMN, I was gonna get in formation and slay if it was the last thing I ever did. From there, the show just kept going for two hours, she sang, danced, and slayed. She sounds live like she sounds on the albums, and she danced for the majority of the time, like she never stopped moving. The intermissions were brief, between the intermissions and the slow songs- I took a breather, because, I unlike Beyoncé needed to rest from all the singing along and jumping I was doing. She did some songs from Destinys Child, the majority of her hits (no show for Irreplaceable and Single Ladies). In the end, after everything, I was just amazed. For one, I could have lived at any time in history, but I get to live in the time of Beyonce. For two, I saw the greatest performer of my generation live. For three, I saw Beyoncé at her peak, with the greatest album she has released (so far). When I'm old- I'm going to be telling the youngins about the time I saw Beyoncé live for the Formation World Tour, and they will be amazed. I can't wait to tell the story. En fin, if you get a chance do it, see Beyoncé because it will change you, transform you, it will slay you, and you will be amazed. ",
Beyoncé,I ended up winning my tickets to Beyonce online. I wasn't a huge fan before the gig but just decided to enter the comp on a win. I loved some of her previous stuff and was intrigued by the new album Lemonade. On arriving at Croke Park in Dublin the buzz was unreal. We were sitting up in the gods in the Cusack stand and we had a great view. We got to see the second support act Chloe x Halle and they were awesome. The noise in the stadium was brilliant everyone was singing and dancing just full of happiness and joy. Then Welcome To The Formation Tour came up on the big screen and the place erupted. When queen B graced the stage her presence was just electric. The whole show from start to finish was absolutely amazing. Bey has such an incredible stage presence and her voice is outstanding. The dancers and choreography was on point and just made you want to get up and shake what your mother gave you haha. I can truthfully say Beyonce gained another super fan in me that night. So entertaining and engaging with the crowd. And that ass!!! My boyfriend came with me (reluctantly!) only to see that ass in the flesh!! By the last part of the concert he was up dancing with me and all the people around us. I have to say where we were sitting was superb because the people around us were so friendly and we had a great time with everyone. Bit of scandal.... There was a girl in our row a few seats up (we'll call her boots girl) and she was giving it loads and more until..... She puked vodka all over the girl sitting in front of her!!!!!!! Now I'm all for having a drink and enjoying myself but seriously there is no need to get that wasted. My heart went out to the poor girl she puked on and everyone seen it. Soooo embarrassing. Everyone in the row in front of booty girl was terrified that they would become her next victim!! On a final note if you ever get a chance to go see Beyonce GO GO GO... You will not be disappointed and u will leave on a high that will last for days after. BEYONCÉ YOU SLAY ,
Beyoncé,"Half of the fun of going to this Beyonce concert was to watch the crowd as I was waiting for my friends. This crowd did not disappoint. Lots of clubbing outfit, even in a chilly place like Seattle. A very pregnant woman wearing mini dress and high heels. Very diverse group of people. But I digress. This was my first Beyonce concert. CONS: I had a high level of expectation due to being told repeatedly that Beyonce is such a perfectionism. So for me this was a letdown. After the opening act of DJ Khaled ended, we had to wait more than 1 hour for Beyonce to show up on stage. What was taking so long? the hair? the makeup? And the acoustics were horrible. Unless you knew the words to her songs, you couldn't make out what she was singing as her voice was totally drowned by the music. She gave us a medley type of show, singing part of a song then segueing into another song. That was disappointing as I like to hear my songs in full. But that's a personal preference. PROS: Beyonce was stunning and seemed to have a great time performing for her fans. Lots of gorgeous visuals, lots of smoky and pyrotechnic effects reminiscent of Las Vegas acts if that's what you're into. Crowd participation. Probably a given as her fans adore her. They do not just sit down to passively be entertained. Most of them were on their feet dancing to the music. Fired up energetic dancing from her and her dancers. And on the few sets where they actually toned down the music and allowed us to hear her voice, Beyonce shone and showed why she is the superstar that she is. ",
Beyoncé,"I am a really big Beyoncé fan and was really pumped up to see her – I'd been waiting for years for the chance. The concert was at our local arena and there were about 18,000 other fans in attendance, so I was worried it might not feel very special. But if anything, that made it more memorable: the place was full of energy and people ready to dance and sing. She was really on it that night and her voice sounded so great. She did her slow songs like “If I was a Boy” with just as much energy and soul as she performs her faster hits like “Drunk in Love” and “All the Single Ladies” (which was epic). Her costumes were equally impressive (she must have changed outfits half a dozen times) and she looked so good in all of them, she truly is a really beautiful lady. Her shows have a kind of sexy appeal and it came off as very authentic, not crass. The way she moved her body and the emphasis she gave on certain songs just made the whole thing one good raunchy affair! During the show she gave a few shout outs to her husband Jay Z and the amazing band she tours with. You can probably imagine, we were so worn out from dancing and singing once the show was over with. Beyoncé has absolutely taken hold as the single most important female performer in pop music these days and if you are lucky enough to see her in concert, that will only help to prove that she belongs in that role. Hopefully she will be back in the near future – I'll be first in line for tickets :) ",
Beyoncé,"The first indication that The Formation World Tour would be a cinematic experience, as well as a sonic one, was when the THX logo appeared on the side screens, along with the signature deep note. A few seconds later, the rotating (sixty-foot, three-dimensional) multimedia display came to life with pulsating black-and-white nudes of Queen Bey spliced with footage of a hawk flying high above its prey. “Welcome to the Formation Tour, can I hear you say ‘I slay!’” Beyoncé, along with about a dozen dancers donning wide-brim hats and black leotards, marched down the catwalk in true formation. Visual clips and poetry about being “Sorry” eased the transition into the track with the deceptive name; all while 50,000 people filled the San Diego stadium with screams that could be heard in Mexico. And as if Bey couldn’t express her discontent with her own two hands, she instructed her dance troupe to line up behind her with arms outstretched; providing an octopus illusion of middle fingers in the air while she told that “boy bye,” before interjecting an acapella version of “Kitty Kat” in between the hook and the famous last verse about “Becky with the good hair.” - See more at: http://ilistensoyoudonthaveto.com/2016/05/14/beyonce-qualcomm-stadium-05-12-16/#sthash.uEnT3Ku1.dpuf ",
Beyoncé,"Beyoncé + Jay Z is the concert experience you think of when you think of the ultimate arena concert experiences. It's the full package - amazing choreography, costume changes every few minutes, stage effects and of course, hit song after hit song. Although as a whole it's an extraordinary, confident show, it is very clear that Beyoncé drives 80% of the action - although Jay-Z is very good, there's nowhere near the same amount of energy or showmanship that makes Beyoncé's songs so exciting. Even at over 2 hours in duration, the show only provides a sample of their formidable discographies - but the selection is solid. You won't get the 10-minute long ""Single Ladies"" jam you've dreamed of, but even the nods to songs like this and ""Countdown"" are unique and memorable. So in all, this is a show that has it all - great remixes, a visual feast and never a break in the action. If you have even just a passing interest in the B+JZ duo, you'll find this an incredibly enjoyable night out. ",
Beyoncé,"I was really looking forward to this show, I've been waiting for years to see Beyoncé. I purchased standing tickets, and yes, I expected that I won't be able to see much of her. What I didn't expect was the drunk people squeezing in front of me after queuing for 1,5hours, and people covering even the little view I had out with their phones to take videos. But even that I can deal with, although it made me sad. What really disappointed me was the sound. Maybe it's just me, I don't know, but unfortunately her voice didn't come through clearly. I could have dealt with all the other things if it was a fantastic audio experience, but I am very very sad to say it wasn't. Beyoncé was amazing of course, but somehow the entire experience is more a negative. I can't even believe I am saying this as I was really excited and convinced I was gonna have a great time, as it's B, she is a perfectionist, sound can't go wrong. It did, I'm sorry. Maybe next time will be better. ",
Beyoncé,"AMAZING! I really love Beyoncé so this was honestly the best night of my entire life. My friend and I were lucky enough and got there early enough to be in the second row in Gold Circle 1 so we were really close. I am quite short so I struggled to see her on the main stage but the 'Monolith' was massive so I could watch her and the visuals on that. She did spend quite a bit of time on the second stage and the runway which was quite disappointing but we could watch the whole thing on the 'Monolith' so that was okay. Amazing band, amazing dancers, amazing crew, amazing visuals - so many talented people made this show what it was. Overall, it was honestly an amazing show, she is such a talented performer and I would definitely pay that to see her again - hopefully soon! 10/10 ",
Beyoncé,"The On The Run 2 tour was amazing with great performances by Beyoncé and Jay-Z. There were obviously large queues to get in early on and the standing pitch was very busy (unsupisingly). However, although Beyoncé’s performance was incredible and full of energy and voice of an angel, Jay-Z had a completely different vibe. I felt that their music did compliment eachother but Jay-Z’s performance didn’t seem as energetic or engaging as Beyoncé. I was hoping to hear a lot of Beyoncé’s ‘Lemonade’ album but unfortunately only 2-3 songs came up from that album. Their collaborative songs were very good I.e Crazy in love, Drunk in love and Deja Vu. In the whole, I had a great experience and though Beyoncé was amazing and proved herself of being Queen B! ",
Beyoncé,"A very EPIC show!!! The opening act were pretty good and they managed not to lose my interest. The seating was amazing! We were right near the stage. The seats that they give are kind of uncomfortable though. The Mercedes Benz Stadium is a very nice venue with friendly vendors and staff. Traffic wasn’t too bad as long as you know how to get around the main crowd. Jay Z and Beyoncé put on a SHOW!!! The vibes that you get when at a Beyoncé concert is always great. I would highly recommend anyone who appreciates music, good dancing, a performance, and loves Beyoncé should definitely see Beyoncé in concert at least once in their lifetime. Wonderful show and can’t wait for her to come back out! ",
Beyoncé,"I received a call from my aunt the day before she had 3 tickets available this same day and she said that she thought about me. She knew I'd like. Well on the 14th I was on my way to Zurich with my cousin and a friend. Aunty accompanied us but stayed out the stadium she doesn't like crowds. The concert was wonderful though under the rain, Beyoncé was just fabulous with great words and encouragement. Beautiful clothes, makeup great though droplets. She was perfect with an energy that can't leave you insensible... She danced, she sang, and she breathed still in between. No mistake. One thing Thank U Universe for this chance, and Thank you Beyoncé you were gorgeous. ",
Beyoncé,"It's been ages since I've been to a venue that HUGE. We bought the ""cheap"" seats at $100 a ticket and were in the second to last row in the section furthest to the left. It was really hard to see anything happening on the stage and the only real view was the jumbotron. The sound was good and the show had wonderful energy. I would have loved to have been able to see more of it, as it's a really visual performance. I was really surprised at how many Jay-Z fans were there and what a huge part he played in the show. I didn't know any of his music, but really enjoyed it. Lots of fun, but don't think I'll go to a show with that many in the crowd again. ",
Beyoncé,"There will always be high expectations for a Beyoncé and Jay-Z show, and they always go above and beyond. The show was a perfect blend of the couple, and the theme of being on the run continued as the performed hit after hit. I loved Bey's rendition of Lauryn Hill's Ex-Factor, as well as the footage of Jay interacting with Blue toward the end of the show. Expect plenty of wardrobe changes from the both of them, and I thought Beyoncé's black American flag skirt/train was to die for!    Also, the show generally begans 1.5 hours after the scheduled time, but it well worth the wait. Bring extra $$$ for great tour merchandise. ",
Beyoncé,"Loved the opening of the show, Dj khaled, fat Joe, Busta Rhymes, Remy Ma, T.I. everything was awesome, screens were big and clear to see form any angle for the stadium. Elevators had assistants, very well organized. Security all over. The only little thing I didn't like was, lights were dimmed down, supposedly to have her come out, she didn't, then turned lights back on, still waiting, with no screens on, nothing in action this took waiting an hour in the mean time. doors opened 7:30PM and she performed at 10;00pm. Never waited this long on her before. love the show and she is amazing. ",
Beyoncé,"This is by far the best concert to ever go to. So much culture, history and things to learn about in the African American community. The couple JayZ and Beyonce teach us nothing but love and how we all should unite with one another. This couple is such a great influence. This concert makes you cry, happy, and turn up. I appreciate being right there at the stage I'm so happy to see them in the flesh. Hands down 10 star show. I never felt so inspired and encouraged to join more in such a great culture that we should share and express better. ",
Beyoncé,"Beyoncé puts on an amazing show, oh my goodness! We had to wait because of a lightening storm but it was well worth the wait. She is an excellent performer, which I already knew from the two times she's performed for the Super Bowl, and I already knew she was a great singer, but this performance blew me away. She's able to put on a full two and a half hour show that's is spectacular from beginning to end. If Beyoncé is coming to your town, do yourself, your eyes, and your ears a favor, and go see her! ",
Beyoncé,"The actual performance that beyonce did was amazing, I was lucky enough to be front row to get a great view of her, however everything else was not. When the doors opened at 5pm you have to get there before to get a good view of her and during the time the crowd was waiting there was no entertainment except for 'DJ MAGNUM' who played really mediocre songs that were very badly mixed, and the other opening act who I don't even know the name of only performed one song. ",
Beyoncé,"I am not the biggest fan of hers, and I have to say that I went to this concert because I adored Lemonade, her latest album. What an amazing show! Beyoncé gave us everything. EVERYTHING. The setting of the event was worthy of an hollywoodian superproduction, both song and dance were of the highest level. This concert is the best I've ever seen so far. What an amazing artist. She truly deserves her name; Queen B, she owned the stage and crowd, and, she slayed! ",
Beyoncé,Best Show EVER! I woke up at 5:30 am and got to Wembley at 8 am and waited for 12 hours and was stuck standing in the same spot for 6 hours straight but it was all worth it when I saw the Queen walk down the runway andninto the stage I was right in front of. She performed about 10 of her best songs right in front of me and countless more hits on other parts of the stage. It has been 2 days and I have still not recovered! 10/10. ,
Beyoncé,"The queen conquered Nashville on 10/02/16! Flawless. She should put her flag and mark her territory!! I felt so empowered as a female last night, I'm a miss independent woman! Her show is amazing, the lights, the stages, the dance routines. Almost the entire audience was dressed in killing high hills and stretch clothes. I felt I was in the fashion week. Tons of Bey's wannabes. Good for them! They rock their outfits. ",
The Weeknd,"The  quintessential emotional artist, The Weeknd brings to stage an performance packed with passion and a desire to please the audience. The first time I heard his mix tape ""House Of Balloons"" I instantly thought ""damn this music sounds sexy."" The production behind each track is practically flawless. What straps your ear to the speaker is the remnants of Michael Jackson mixed with a sound of James Blake streamlined into one perfect-pitch voice. The acoustics of Radio City (NYC) amplified his voice so well it felt like an invisible blanket wrapping you up in soft and warm harmonies. His stage energy is off the chart and he interacts with the crowd throughout his entire performance. I also found the concert production to be stellar, there were LED lighting panels that covered the entire stage re-creating the streets of Tokyo, Japan. The usage of cameras in the stage to project the image of the crowd and The Weeknd on the LED panels is another way in which he kept the audience sucked into his performance. If I didn't know better I would say his dance moves come straight out of a Michael Jackson video from the 90s. Soulful, lively, passionate, and a sexy sound is how I would have to sum him up. The Weeknd is a must see! ",
The Weeknd,"Abel Tesfaye known as ""The Weeknd"" is a Canadian R&B artist from Scarborough, Ontario. A district of the city Toronto. He left home one weekend and never came back. Hence the name The Weeknd. The Weeknd's music is very sexy and most likely aimed to women. His lyrics contain sexual content and his desires of what he would like to do to them. When you are there. Live. In front of him. It really does feel like he is singing to you! His band knows what he wants and knows how to please an audience. There's Japanese writings and visuals that were incorporated since it was the theme of his recent album ""Kissland"" The fans go wild and you can't help but go wild too! The feeling of being there is intense! You even got to have a chance to meet him so he could sign your CD! This gives you ladies a chance to see him one on one! Of course the line will seem like its forever but it is definitely worth it. He inspires so many aspiring singers to go after their dreams. His vocals were claimed to be ""the next Michael Jackson"" and I sure do agree! A very sexy and soothing voice and I really do think everyone is with me on this one! The vibe of being there is amazing and it is a privilege for anyone to go there! ",
The Weeknd,"This review might not be completely objective as Abel has been my favourite singer for a few years now. However, I can definitely admit the Starboy tour date in Paris was the best pop concert I've been to this year. Even though some songs could have been put out of the tracklist, he mostly sang his catchiest songs of his career, no matter the era. He has great, or should I say, tremendous energy as he continuously sang twenty-something songs with no pause in between. He has no trouble reaching high notes live, his voice sounding even more heavenly in real life. That night, he invited Travis Scott on stage who pumped up the crowd more than him, which is a shame and showcases very well his lack of success and recognition in France, yet, in a sold out stadium. Most people actually didn't even know his real name or the lyrics of his songs ! I would recommend any ""real fan"" who has known him for a while or who likes his last album a lot to go to a Starboy tour date. I promise you, you won't regret it. ",
The Weeknd,"I loved it! There were 3 openingsacts, which I thought were a lot but they were all really good! I really enjoyed Bryson Tiller, I really think he has great potential. But The Weeknd was everything. It was even better than I could imagine and I was thinking big. He did a lot of songs and everybody was singing along and everything just was so perfect. He sounded amazing and with one song he let us all sing and nobody could hit the high notes and he smiled so freaking cute. It went by so fast. Also it was quite funny how big of an age difference there was between the fans. There were elderly people, like a grandmother and her granddaughter together and this elderly couple,... Of course there were a lot of young people. And there also were young teenagers with their friends. Everything was organized very well. And I would definitely go again. ",
The Weeknd,"The concert was absolutely stunning. A starship was used and the lights were coordinated very well. Abel sang amazingly in person and I loved jumping up and down screaming with other members of the audience while he sang. The concert was truly magical and I enjoyed every second Abel stood on stage. As for the other singers who appeared on stage, I was very satisfied with their singing as well. They did an amazing job and captured the entire audience. In between Abel's music, the other singers such as Lil Uzi and 6lack played their hits on stage and the whole crowd became even more alive. If I the concert played out any other way, I'm sure I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much as this concert. ",
The Weeknd,This concert was awesome. The lines were a block away and round a corner it was crazy. We waited bout 2 hours but some waited even more. The weekend had  a great live band with solos. I had made it to the near front on the floor.next time I will just be on the balcony because there was a lot of pushing going on throught the night. Not only that but it was like being in a sweat box. A lot of people were allowed to smoke ganja and there were drinks to be served of course. About two people passed on near me which is scary but predictable at a concert extreme as this one. Over all a memorable experience for me and my friends. ,
The Weeknd,"The Weeknd was my first official concert and will be my most memorable. The emotion of the songs live is so fulfilling just knowing he's right there in front of me, it's like some weird connection that I can't explain. He felt the song when he sang it and I think that is so unique, most artists sing it so much it's just putting on a performance for them but this was deeper than that. I wish I could relive that feeling again, where I get chills when he can hit that notes so well. I don't care if this review gets published, I just wanted to state how this concert felt. ",
The Weeknd,"This was such a great show!! I would definitely see him live again. Pros: -great light display/props/theatrics -good djs -he sang music from all his albums which was well appreciated! -he interacted with the crowd -he sings AMAZING live -chill atmosphere Cons: -performers/musicians were smoking weed on stage -Abel took a longgg time to get on stage, we were there for almost two hours before he did -crowd was very drunk & rude (not his fault) -merchandise was very expensive (I payed $40 for a t-shirt) ",
The Weeknd,"The show was awesome!!! No surprise, The Weeknd is even better live than he is on record! Nonetheless, his beautiful voice blows me away every time I hear him. Such a true, talented artist; one of the few left in our generation. Again the show was great, the only thing I wish was different was that I wish the show was longer than an hour & a half-2 hours and I would have loved to have heard some of his older songs! ",
The Weeknd,"The Weeknd is amazing live.  His voice is incredible and he is beyond talented.  Also, the stage production for the Legend of the Fall tour was unlike anything I've ever seen before.  The Star Destroyer-esque prop moving above the stage was so cool.  Loved every minute of it.  Well worth the outrageous cost of the ticket for an obstructed view by the stage. ",
The Weeknd,"Overall, if you get a chance to go see The Weeknd, GO! It was the best night of my life. While the terrible Hollywood Bowl shuttle caused us to miss the Jhene Aiko set, Schoolboy Q was pretty great as well. When Abel came on, the energy changed and everyone was going crazy. He is hands down my favorite artist and I am forever thankful that I could go. ",
The Weeknd,"This was the best show I have ever seen in my whole life. The incredible lighting paired with Abel's enthusiasm and the attitude that the whole crowd shared made this an unforgettable experience. There is nothing better than hearing your favourite artist live and next time the Weeknd comes back to Australia, I'm definitely going again. ",
The Weeknd,MY SON THOUGHT WHEN HE HEARD PARTY MONSTER THAT IT WAS A MICHEAL JACKSON SONG BUT I KNEW BETTER. I HAVE HEARD THAT MJ WAS A BIG INFLUENCE IN ABEL'S LIFE. I HOPE HE WILL BE AROUND A LONG TIME AND DON'T CHANGE A THING CAUSE WHAT YOU BE DOING IS SO FINE AND ITS WORKING. :)  LYNN POTLAND OR   YES IT SAYS POT-LAND LOL ,
The Weeknd,Despite you advertising The Weeknd performing on the Anti tour with Rihanna he pulled out of the tour months ago - something you obviously forgot to update - I am positive that if he has been performing he would have been absolutely amazing but alas and to my extreme disappointment he wasn't there ! ,
The Weeknd,The Weeknd's ledgend of the fall lives up to the name. He brought out day one homeboy drake and the atmosphere was unbelievable. With just himself and a live band on stage you cannot take your eyes of his performance. Finally my bucket list is completed. Loved and been a fan since Trilogy. ,
The Weeknd,"The Weeknd’s concert was so good. My throat hurts from so much yelling. He’s so adorable, someone said I love you to him and said I love you too baby back AWWW. He also brought out Kodak black as a surprise guest. The way the venue was set up was so pretty. ",
The Weeknd,"I really really really enjoyed the concert . The wait was worth waiting. I hope you come back to New Orlean. I hope I get a chance to meet you next time. I didn't want you to leave and the artist you had with you, I enjoyed them to! Please come back!!!!!!!!!! ",
The Weeknd,"AMAZING. Abel gave it his all for 90+ minutes and sang a variety of new and old songs. Absolutely worth every cent. Travis $cott and DJ Khaled made an appearance. American Airlines arena was great. Would reccomend the venue, the Weeknd, Travis, etc ",
The Weeknd,"AMAZING EXPERIENCE! He brought out several surprise guests that just kept making the concert better and better. Would definitely recommend. Tickets are a bit pricey, but even getting balcony or lawn tickets would still be an amazing time. ",
The Weeknd,"Very cool show, with amazing lights, singer and scenery. Awesome music and atmosphere! Also with a cheap ticket, you had the chance for a good place. Awesome singers before the weeknd came. Cool merch! Contra: He came very to the show:/ ",
Lil Wayne,"In a black hoodie, red cap and sunglasses, Lil Wayne started at the top — croaking lyrics at the crowd from the elevated stage like some sort of gangsta Muppet. It didn’t take long to establish himself as a master of the game with “Blunt Blowin”, “John” and “Steady Mobbin”. Then he politely thanked the audience (as he did after every set) and left the stage. Drake immediately came out as the antithesis to his opponent. Dressed all in white with a simple gold chain, looking like a college kid, Drake started at the bottom (stage) with “Draft Day”, “We Made It” and “The Language”. He didn’t leave with a simple thank you though, he needed to establish the tone first. Admitting Lil Wayne was his boss and mentor, he assured us he was going to “roast that muthafucka alive”. Wayne addressed any concerns when he came back out to give everyone a history lesson. “I heard this kid saying he was going to roast me alive. I’ve been doing this shit since he was in a wheelchair.” The Degrassi jokes continued through the set, as Wayne kept referring to Drake as Jimmy. There was also a lot of banter about hits vs. classics, as Wayne admitted Drake has more ‘hits’, but that he was lacking in the ‘classics’ department.    The boxing format went on for 4 rounds. Each artist upping their game in each round. The jokes were there, but as the night went on, the jokes were interlaced with more and more respect for each other. Everything about the Battle Round was in good fun. Verse after hook after verse — they took jabs, but never came to blows. In one breath they would credit their success to one another, and in the next breath, they would call each other’s songs “cute”. It was part hip hop show, part comedy, part roast, but it was all together one of the most entertaining things I have witnessed two rappers do…ever. After a short DJ break, they both came out for the finale. “6 Foot 7 Foot”, “All Me”, “Started From The Bottom” and “The Motto” were highlights, but “Believe Me” (a collab from Wayne’s upcoming album) and the final final “HYFR (Hell Ya Fucking Right)” were among the best performances of the night.    At the end of it all, they called it a draw. Supposedly Drake was 1 point ahead on the tour, so he left Red Rock with his 1 point lead. And although I went in as a diehard Wayne supporter, I believe the draw was fair. Who knows if the app really determined the winner. I’m guessing it might all be fixed and they’ll come out in a tie at the end of the tour. That would make sense. But as for their performances on Wednesday night, I think they proved that they both have their strengths and weaknesses, but they are better together. Drake’s smooth, sometime monotonous flow and crooning voice are the perfect remedy to Wayne’s quirks, alien persona and unintelligible lyrics…and vice versa. So the format of this show was perfect. It allowed the strengths to hide the flaws in each artist. It went on for 2 1/2 hours and there wasn’t a single lull in the set. People paid good money to see Drake and Lil Wayne battle it out. They got their money’s worth. At the end of the day, I believe that there were multiple winners. Drake and Lil Wayne were both honestly appreciative to have played the stage at Red Rocks. And they both got paid. The promoters and companies behind the tour will also profit from ticket and merch sales. We won as well. Those of us who were big enough fans of either Drake or Lil Wayne to have spent the money for the show were rewarded with one the best and most unique hip hop events I have ever attended. http://ilistensoyoudonthaveto.com/2014/09/12/drake-vs-lil-wayne-red-rocks-09-10-14/ ",
Lil Wayne,"If you are a fan of rap, then a Lil Wayne concert is unquestionably THE concert to attend. When he performs, he gets really into his music (and so will you). It really makes the concert so much better that he is so passionate and his lyrics have so much meaning – it goes way beyond him just spitting out words. I've seen him a bunch of times now, and his concerts are a funny mixture: so chill, yet full of so much energy at the same time. If you know the rap, you rap along. I love when he performs A Milli because that is one of my favorite songs (and it is also one that I know word for word, so I love to rap along with him). A good thing about a Lil Wayne concert is you don't feel like you have to dress to impress. Most time when you go to concerts, people get really hung up about feeling like they should dress up and look really great. For a Lil Wayne concert, it doesn't matter if you wear jeans and a tshirt. No one is judging. Everyone is there to have a good time – him included: his stage setup is usually super simple. There are no distractions, just him and his mic. Lil Wayne is amazingly talented with words and in person he's a great performer. He simply entertains, and that's what makes his concerts so good. ",
Lil Wayne,The wayne vs drake concert was amazing! They performed almost every hit they ever made and they really brought all their energy on stage and they interacted with the crowd. Each artist performed his best and left everything on that stage. The atmosphere was so much fun and i cant wait to go to another one of their concerts! Drake on the stripper pole was pretty amazing too! It was just the most fun concert ive ever been too ,
Lil Wayne,Lil Wayne is a rockstar. He has so much energy and really gets the crowd going. He is a team player and was a joy to see on stage with 2 chainz. The staples center was a great venue for this show. My high expectations were met during the BET experience. I want a surprised by how many beginning acts were also there. Well done weezy!!! ,
Lil Wayne,"It was veerrrrrrrrrrrryyyyyyy disappointing, I paid to see lil wayne  and he was a no show for the 2nd time in a row this concert was a reschedule from Feb. I was excited to see Lil Wayne but he was a no show I would like to have my money back for the disappointment. ",
Lil Wayne,Waited over 3 hours never saw Wayne so we finally just left. Very disappointed. Concert held in a very shady area. Seating was very uncomfortable. This experience most definitely has made my mind up about concerts. This will be the last one. ,
Lil Wayne,"IT....was incredible! He was lively, on point and it will go down as the best concert I've ever seen and I've seen A LOT! The two opening acts were fun also. He did all old school because he's jammed up with label but we did not mind at all! ",
Lil Wayne,It was an awesome ass concert. Lil wayne was amazing! I would definitely go again to see him perform. The opening act was really really good and I stayed for parts of blink 182 but lil wayne definitely killed it last night ,
Lil Wayne,Awesome show! I took my oldest son (15) and his friend for his birthday. They had an absolute blast & loved it. Thanks for putting on a great show. We would definitely go to another Lil Wayne concert. Fantastic!!! ,
Lil Wayne,The guy showed up 3hours late with no apologies and he's only performed during 1 hour. Bullshit. Worst live ever. ,
Katy Perry,"I took my daughter to see Katy Perry for her 9th birthday; we went with my friend Laura and her 9 year old daughter. We had nosebleed seats at the Verizon Center, but I still felt we saw everything clearly, so I didn't mind. (Verizon center hold 18,000 people - it's an indoor stadium in the heart of DC.)    We arrived at 7:10 and the first opener was already going strong: Ferras, who I have since learned is a Jordanian singer-songwriter based in LA and the first to sign onto Katy Perry's new label. He was a little to boy band/R&B-sounding for my taste, but he did have stage presence. He spent most of his time behind keyboards, so he didn't move around much on the huge stage, but he did have a pink neon sign of his name behind him. I give him a ""meh"".    Capital Cities went on at 8 pm. I had previewed more of their music before attending this show, and it turns out I like a few of their songs, not just the famous one ""Safe and Sound"". Capital Cities is technically a duo from LA, but they brought a few other musicians on the tour with them. The trumpeter really stood out on stage, and I liked the band's neon jackets with the reflective stripes as costumes. They were better about using the whole stage than Ferras. They walked the catwalk sometimes and had a dance-party to a remix of Safe and Sound as their exit song where the band just danced and ran around like maniacs. It was adorable, and smart reinforcement of their hit single. (They also played the original version in the middle of the set.) The band was also savvy enough to remember to tell the crowd their name, unlike Ferras. (That is my #1 pet peeve with openers  - it's marketing 101, musicians!)    Katy Perry went on right at 9 pm and was coming back for an encore at 11:15 when we left. I almost never see shows with 2 hour sets, so that was a bit of a shock to me, but honestly, she kept our attention the entire time. All the rumors I'd heard about her amazing stage shows were 100% true. She brought it. Elaborate video backdrops, huge props that came up through trapdoors in the floor of the stage, a giant V shaped runway with general admission standing room in the middle, conveyor belts as part of that runway, amazing laser lights (better light design than I've ever seen at an show), acrobats, amazing dancers, lots of costume changes - you name it, she did it. By the end of it, I could see why someone would shell out $175 for a floor seat to this show. (And a lot more for VIP ""experiences"" like meet and greets.)    Prismatic - glow tube costumes, gemstone background, best glitter effect ever from laser lights, arrived through floor that opened like gem facets, umbrellas and glowing spears  Roar   Part of Me   Wide Awake   This Moment / Love Me Egyptian - rode an oversized gold puppet horse, hunks in chest straps, a rapper as the sphinx in a cartoon video,  twisty platform rose high in the air with Katy on it.  Dark Horse   E.T.   Legendary Lovers   I Kissed a Girl   Cat-Oure - a long, funny kitty meme cartoon video for set change (does she EVER know her audience!), cat costumes, reference to ""Katy Kats"" fan club, cat couture runway show to Vogue, oversized cat scratching posts with carpet perches  Hot N Cold   International Smile   (Contains elements of 'Vogue' by Madonna)  Acoustic - sunflower set, fairy princess costume, selfie photo, gave a pizza to a kid, talked to all the kids in the audience in a way that connected well  By the Grace of God   The One That Got Away / Thinking of You   Unconditionally   Throwback - harness flying, silk over the audience pit, cloud effects, platform and crazy 1-story-high bell skirt  yin-yang dress, giant puppet butterflies.   Walking on Air   It Takes Two   This Is How We Do / Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)   Hyper Heon - neon 80s clothes, neon floating parade float balloons in audience (including Cover Girl marketing tie-in lipstick), inflatable full sized pink convertible that dancers rode in, moving neon letters that spelled out various words, Katy wore a bra made of 2 big smiley faces with a third big one on her butt  Teenage Dream   California Gurls   Birthday Encore:(We missed this)  Firework ",
Katy Perry,"Katy Perry's Prismatic Tour is a zany, colorful world of wonder from her opening number of ""Roar"" to an encore filled with pyrotechnics and an audience jumping up and down screaming for more.    I must say that I was impressed with Katy's live vocals, they were much more impressive than I was expecting. She does a full 2 hour set of all of her hits and a few favorites from her new album, Prism. That's right, I said 2 hours!! And that didn't include support from her opening acts, Ferras and Capital Cities, both of which had you up and dancing before Katy's grand arrival.    This is show is camper than any drag show I've ever seen. This girl loves a theme and commits. She opened the show with the Prismatic set with a Greecian warrior vibe and light up costumes. She then transported the audience to Egypt where she arrived on a moving horse. Dancers were dressed as pharohs, black spiders and bootylicious mummies! After yet another costume change, Katy appeared on a giant ball of yarn in a hot pink cat suit singing a cabaret style version of ""Hot N Cold"" for her Cat-Oure section, transitioning into ""International Smile"" which even featured a Kitty fashion runway to Madonna's ""Vogue."" Things were then slowed down for an acoustic set in Katy's magical garden with sunflowers and giant floating butterflies. Next was my personal favorite, Throwback, which was a full-fledged 90's dance party. Smiley faces, ying-yang signs and bicycle shorts were in abundance. This set was already crazy fun and then they filled the stadium with giant emoji balloons including a taco and a smiling poo. Katy closed the show in Hyper Neon with some of her biggest hits and returned to stage for an encore of ""Firework.""    If you're in need of a smile, this show is a sure fire ticket! Both Katy Perry and her show are wonderfully light-hearted and full of love. If you don't have a sense of humor, this show might not be for you. I think my only note would be to be prepared for heards of young tween girls. I know, I know it's Katy Perry not U2, but sometimes I forget that I'm 28 year old trapped in a 13 year old's body. ",
Katy Perry,"Katy Perry wowwed us here in Toon Town. I caught her previous tour with Janelle Monae and thought that it would be impossible to top. WRONG! She brought 2 warm up acts - each doing about 45-50 minute sets.. (Unforuntately I missed the first one but Kacey Musgraves was great. She had a harder country rock sound that worked and she used all of the stage and the audience joined in on a few of her tunes.)  Then came the Prismatic Tour. Like last time Katy had a theme - angles edges and reflections (Katy in Wonderland last time.)  The stage and runway was in the form of diamond and the back screen was a segmented pyramid. Compared to the previous tour it looked a bit sparse and toned down. Ooops! There's actually more hidden site which involved treadmills, lifts and it ended up being more elaborate than last time.  Her 2 hour plus performance included songs from all three albums but many with a new spin - Broadway musical treatment and one almost throwback to the torch song era on one of her biggest hits. A lot was going on but the stage wasn't too busy for the eye.   There was very creative use of costumes, props, video and lasers and you must make sure you stay for Prism vision. (Some people left because they thought the show was over.)  Katy was her usual funny, honest and warm self and there was a precious moment when she had  a picture taken with a 5 year-old look-a-like (no cell phone for a selfie.)   Katy loves her fans and it showed. I think she really loved our little ""Town""   too and that added to her performance. (She was here for the Warped Tour 7 years ago and she said it's been too long.)  Her show is a fun experience with lots of surprizes (I won't give anymore spoilers) and she is definitely one to catch. Her show has appeal to beyond her fans and this tour confirmed to me that she is one of those performers you must see each time she is near - you may not like the music but you have to experience it at least once. (Kiss falls into this category as do the Stones, Cher and such.) ",
Katy Perry,"To say right now that watching Katy Perry live is a total MUST is, actually, quite an understatement. Just a look at her current tour sales will tell you that almost no one  wants to miss her latest live production. But watching Katy Perry live is more than just a show, it's more of a lovely memory you will share with friends you didn't know you had. Katy Perry is one of those artists who fully commits herself to bring her fans an experience that displays cutting edge production while keeping a deeply intimate vibe. There's little chance you'll see her outside the local major arena these days, and still she always makes it feel like a tiny place and like every song is been sung directly to you. No, that does not have anything to do with me watching her on the stage fence everytime. It has to do with how she gets involved with every aspect of the show, as opposed to just focusing on performing, making it all even more personal. On every tour, she plays the full new album, while incorporating the fan favorite songs in a nicely balanced set, always full of awesome custome changes and stage surprises. Her long-time live band and dance crew are always a powerhouse by themselves and just add to the whole experience. The songs live always have enhanced arrangements which prove her musicianship while shocking many naysayers. The first time she took her full tour to Mexico, was with the California Dreams Tour in 2011, with her first stop in Guadalajara. Eager to see her perform that perfect album live more than once I hopped on an overnight bus and made the trip by myself. The joy in the air that night, the perfection of the set, and the overall happiness in everyone's face throughout the show, allowed me to make new friends with whom I'm now making travel arrangements to see the 4 nights in Mexico of her new Prismatic World Tour. Only god knows what this tour has in store for me... liveshowjunkie, May 2014 ",
Katy Perry,"From aztec warriors to Katy cats chasing down an evil rat, the Katy perry concert was outstanding. Despite the loads of hatred towards the newly 30 pop star, Perry came out with a bang and put on a show that will be remembered for a lifetime. With Katy's set list covering her original hits such as ""I Kissed A Girl"" to her new hits like ""Roar,"" Katy rocked the nearly packed Prudential Center. After her first few numbers that featured dancers and lights galore, Katy proceeded to chage throughout the show into her countless eclectic outfits. By far the acrobatic tricks and light performances combined with her beautiful voice and unique stage,  Katy truly set herself apart from every other performer. With areas of the stage moving up and down, in circles, and across the stage, Perry was allowed to perform in every inch of the concert venue. Despite some technical difficulties in the beginning of the concert, Perry was able to recover extremely well and maintain her positive and cheerful view on life and uplift the audience. What sets Katy's concert apart from others was her powerful connection with the audience, giving the audience the feeling that she truly cared about and loved each and every single one of her fans. From taking selfies with members of the audience to giving one lucky girl an entire pizza, Katy's sweet and genuine personality was shown by these unique experiences with her biggest fans. With ""Birthday"" finally featuring more flying tricks, a volunteer from the audience, confetti, and a ginormous birthday cake, the concert was ended just as extravagantly as it began. I would strongly recommend anyone who enjoys her music and enjoys having a great time to go see Katy Perry in concert. She truly does know how to perform! ",
Katy Perry,"I don't believe, in my 32 years on this planet, that I have ever looked forward to a concert as much as I did this Katy Perry venture. (Which is saying A LOT considering how many amazing concerts I've been to.)    ...and what a concert it was. Katy DID NOT disappoint. If you are a fan of Katy Perry...if you are a fan of fantastical pop music...if you are a fan of dancing your a** off without fear of some bloke grinding your back pockets off - GO SEE KATY. 2+ Hours of pure, unadulterated pop bliss. Booming beats, live soaring vocals, prismatic colors, and tons of cute, well-coiffed, well-choreographed dancers. I can't gush enough about the Prismatic experience. I dare say Katy is holding tight to the crown of Pop music right now, and it is reflected by the obviously large budget she had to work with when designing her show. Seriously, though, she covered tracks from all three of her albums. She did take what I consider to have been a well-deserved breather in the middle of the show with a stripped down acoustic segment before she ramped right back up into confetti and cotton candy mayhem. She had a great rapport with her audience and seemed to be genuinely appreciative of us, and the life she's been given. GO. Unless you're an anti-pop stooge, you WILL NOT be disappointed. ",
Katy Perry,"The concert was a disappointment. Having purposely flown over to singapore to see her, leaving my toddler and baby behind with my parents in the hotel, we were expecting an entertaining performance based on reviews on her tour. However, It has proven otherwise. Felt that her effort wasn't there and that there's not much stage presence. Keeps disappearing behind stage for her attire etc.. We don't get to see her enough on stage. She didn't really captivate the crowd and seems like she's only doing the concert for the sake of doing it only. The singing was pre-recorded at some parts - dancing was not energetic. The part where a fan was invited to stage was pretty interesting.  That made everyone smiled. Wish she could have done more like that - connect with the crowd with her singing. Thought the prismatic effect was very cool. Aside from that, this is by far the most boring concert we've been to :( ",
Katy Perry,"Wow! just wow! Katy Perry you know how to start and end a show! the thing I will definetly take away the most from this concert is when she spoke to us. not just through words. but singing as well. each costume she changed into represented something different. the way she acted on stage was like it was just you and her for two hours. well she actually said that. haha. my favorite part of the concert was well... let me think!... oh wait! I got it!..... EVERYTHING!!! I loved everything about the show! what's not to love. I mean you're at a Katy Perry concert where you can rock out, dress up, even die your hair different colors and no one can judge you. Because as Katy said last night at the concert, a Kitty Kat is a very real person, who loves life -  and those people, the Kitty Kat's, are us. the fans. so thanks Katy Perry for putting on a show I'll never forget! :) ",
Katy Perry,"Two words: SO AWESOME. The lights, the outfits, the love. She came on stage with a sparkly red outfit and came out of an eyeball. She sang some songs in the outfit like Chained to the rhythm and Dark Horse. Then she sang a lot of throwback songs all at once, she sang hot n cold (with a bra that changed from hot to cold) , California Gurls, Last Friday night, E.T, teenage dream, and I kissed a girl. Then she got a huge almost desert setup, I even think there was a stripper pole for Bom appetit. Then she was flying on a planet while in a sparkly white outfit. She sang wide awake, power, thinking of you, and she invited a fan onstage. It was cute. Then she got in a blue outfit and sang Swish Swish, hey hey hey, and roar. Then she went off stage. Then came back for the encore, which was a slower version of Firework. Definitely recommend seeing her live. ",
Katy Perry,"It was amazing! She is an amazing performer and rocked that show with all the outfits and character she put into it. Only bump i figured was, that when you are not in front, you can’t see her. The catwalk was fine but i couldnt see her the entre time she was on the “main” part of the stage. I’m am tall so especially young ones where dissapointed (this was also because of the tall dad’s). Fortunatly she used the catwalk often so i could experience her a couple times up close. (I was at the end of the catwalk). It was really fun she flew in the sky and come to the end of the stage with firework, that balanced it out and i had the oppertunity to really enjoy her performance. Thank you so much! I had a blast! ",
Katy Perry,"Katy's show was flawless. Wonderful. Perfect. One thing that made me unhappy was in the souvenir part. A few things that interested me. So I asked one person to pick me up (since I was in the bleachers and away from the stage) 3 papers that came out of the cannon that threw confetti. I put it in a picture frame as a reminder of a very important moment in my life. Unfortunately, the security guards barred me when I went to get more .. But I have no complaint about the show. Katy always flawless in what she does. PS: I do not speak English very well, but I'm learning English so I can talk to Katy Perry someday. Good luck to me, right?! ",
Katy Perry,"Ho vissuto un esperienza indescrivibile, non esistono parole sufficienti per poter descrivere ciò che ho visto. L'atmosfera che si era creata grazie alla stupenda @katyperry, l'Intera @unipolarena era diventata una persona unica ad amare incondizionatamente lei, la donna che mantiene i sogni di migliaia di persone... Ieri si è avverato il mio ""Teenege Dream"", non mi dimenticherò mai di tutte le emozioni, le sensazioni e lo spettacolo a cui ho assistito. Mai, remember: -KatyCats is a promise- Così posso finalmente dichiarare di essere stato testimone di Katy la scorsa notte. I'm a witness ",
Katy Perry,"The show was exceptionally stunning and fascinating! Through the hyper glamour of the Egyptian and the other sections, it was clearly a eye opening spectacle. Katy's vocals were good and there was clear improvement from her vocal performances. However, the full show wasn't performed at Singapore, with songs such as 'This Moment' and 'Birthday' not being performed. Katy was also late for the concert for some reasons and the show started 1 hour later... Nevertheless, the show was clearly an expertly crafted feast for the eyes and I encourage all to go for this remaining legs of her tour. ",
Katy Perry,"Katy Perry is a great entertainer and she puts on a special effects filled show! She is funny, creative, inspiring, and bold. In this show she brought the Superbowl shark with her and had fun, she called her Mom, she brought some kids on stage,then brought a dad on stage during the Swish Swish song, she was very active throughout the show, too. She sang about 5 songs from the Witness album and the rest from her other albums. Loved her song choices. She was upbeat, as she always is during her shows, and kept us moving. Great show to see!! ",
Katy Perry,"Amazing show! Katy gave everything she has on stage! The vocals, costumes, interludes, visuals were just wonderful! She is such a powerhouse vocally and connected with audience very deeply! Tove Styrke was cool too. Katy delivered really amazing tour and sang her latest hits with her older jams and ballads! Everyone who is looking for amazing, heart-stopping concert experience and eye-popping visuals that will be feast for your retinas Witness The Tour is perfect show! ",
Katy Perry,"Katy Perry is simply amazing and fun to watch on stage.  The show is simply spectacular, the lights, the props, the dancers.  I will say from all the concerts I have attended in the last 2 years her and Sia’s were the best.  Katy Parry gets involved with the audience, she is a  beautiful woman and has stage grace with a killer smile.  I am so so happy I was able to see her for the first time live, I will again in the future and I am sure of that. ",
Katy Perry,"The concert was amazing. Both Katy Perry and charli xcx did an excellent job! I'm very disappointed with the crowd, however, and clearly so was Katy. They didn't really sing along, weren't loud and there was basically no emotion. This was my second concert in Germany and the second time this happens. I'm from Brazil and this just felt wrong. I'm sorry Katy. I want you to know that I was dancing and singing and screaming the whole. Damn. Show. ",
Katy Perry,"One of the Best shows i've ever watched . Actually i took my 11 years old daughter, Manuela, a huge fan of Katy Perry. Manuela introduce me a few songs of Katy's great success before the show , but i didn't realize how spetacular would be the show! I became a fan of her's imediately! The performance and the visual effects were incredible! Katy showed us her talent as a singer, dancer and as human being! We can't watt  for the next show! ",
Katy Perry,"Katy Perry was awesome!  She worked the crowd and played wonderful music for all ages.  I loved the beat and the rhythm whole heartedley and I would recommend this concert to everyone.  I had taken a train to see it so what that meant was that I had to take the train home, so we had to leave the concert fifteens minutes early to catch the train.  I was so disappointed to miss the last three songs.  Katy what did I miss?! ",
Katy Perry,"As always, Katy puts on a great show. She sang a lot of songs including songs from her new album but also classic favorites. Every 4 songs or so, there's a video interlude for her to change her costume. But she doesn't disappoint with her outfits. One of the best parts is when she is able to poke fun at herself and brings Left Shark on stage during California Girls. ",
Justin Bieber,"I wanna say that last night with Justin Bieber was perfect and amazing and so nice and very beautiful show in the world ever. And he was soo HOT when he was without T-shirt on the stage. I just don't believe it, that I have seen him. It was a big dream for me and finally this dream coming true I'm really so happy. And I don't believe that I have seen Justin's face. And I look at him when he dancing and singing allot of my favorite songs of his songs. OH MY GOD I will never ever never forget it, he is sooo beautiful more than the pictures on instagram or facebook or twitter and whatever he is just like an angel. Aaaaa I'm gonna die right now. He is my everything I want marry him and want be with him cause he is my life and my love and my sweetheart and my cute he is just my everything I love Justin so much more than anything. This world is very beautiful because he is in this world. I love my world because of him cause he is my world.... Really thank you so much Justin for amazing show in cologne. You was so perfect. I will never forget it and I will never forget your beautiful face too cause your beautiful face make me happy and your the big reason for me to leave in this world really thank you so much Justin love you baby forever. PROUD TO BEING A BELIEBER.. 17/9/2016 is a new birthday for me because I have seen you my beautiful JB. I promise you that I will be one of beliebers family forever. And always be there just for you. I promise you Justin Bieber. Love you so much my cute. ",
Justin Bieber,"I saw Justin Bieber perform live a few years ago, at the O2 arena in London. It was long before Bieber had begun to cement a rather bad reputation for himself, so I went to the concert with the doe eyed innocence of a young Belieber excited to see her idol. Even now, despite the bad press, there is no doubt that Bieber is an extremely talented artist and that his concerts are one hell of a show- a once in a lifetime experience. Bieber proved that he had real, as opposed to manufactured, talent on stage. He sung all his songs live, and his voice was undeniably good. Even more impressive was his dance moves. Bieber dominated the stage, dancing round and showing off some expert moves with seemingly total ease. Classic such as ‘Baby’ and ‘Boyfriend’ were all obviously performed. When Bieber performed ‘One Less Lonely Girl’, he brought a random audience member on stage with him. He sung to her and presented her with a beautiful bouquet, breaking young hearts everywhere. The girls standing in front of me were actually crying with jealousy at this point (when Bieber had first appeared on stage, it was tears of happiness). The highlight of the show was when mentor Usher appeared to perform ‘Somebody to Love’, the duo’s dancing was off the chain at this point! ",
Justin Bieber,"Hi Justin Bieber, I wanted to tell you that I have no idea what I'm doing RIGHT now, but anyways I've heard you've went to Philly for a concert. I wish I was there, my heart is broken right now cause I wasn't able to go. I thought I was but I guess my family just didn't have money for me and my twin sister at all. (Even though I'm still belieber and my twin isn't!)  We only live a hour and a half away from the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia Pennsylvania (PA). Wow!!! Well, I really wanted to tell you that I want you to come back to Philly and perform this year AGAIN. Please. I don't want to rush you but I never went to your performance. I'm only 12 years old, I have a twin, five sisters. My older sister doesn't even act like a sister, and I've never done anything fun, like nothing exciting, fun, in my whole life. And all I want, at least, I want to do is go to your performance In Philadelphia PA. It would be very great and I'll never forget about it and you. Well it would be cool if you came back to Philly again, hopefully I don't miss it, cause this time since my mom don't have money I'll save up money for us four to see you. (If its possible for my broke self.) But see yah Justin Bieber, I don't know how to end this paragraph. Ummmmmm byeeeeeee, luv u! lol :) ",
Justin Bieber,"Justin seemed kind of out of it during at least the first half of the show. He took two pretty long breaks (at least 5 minutes) where it seemed like the dancers and other people on stage didn't really know what was going on. At one point he just stood on stage in silence for several minutes facing the back, confusing the crew, perfomers, and audience. I think he might be sick because he was coughing a lot and lip-synced quite a bit. He also let the audience sing a lot of his songs. Some highlights were when he played the guitar and sang acoustic versions of some songs, his drum solo, and his performance of upbeat hits like Company, Sorry, and Baby. He didn't interact as much with his audience as I had expected. Unfortunately, he is not doing OLLG during the Purpose tour. He sings really well and the audience is very engaged, possibly more than himself. I recommend going IF, like me, you've been a fan for a while and really want to see him. If you just like his music, it's not worth it because it's not a very captivating performance and it won't be worth the money. Additionally his merchandise definitely isn't that nice, especially considering the cost. ",
Justin Bieber,"Last night was the best night of my life I think I'm still in shock tbh. Justin looked so happy and healthy last night and that's all I could ever ask for. He may mime for some songs but that doesn't even bother me just breathing the same air and being in the same room as him is a dream come true. Although I fainted just before he performed cold water because I was too claustrophobic I still got straight back up as soon as I heard the start of cold water and carried on having an amazing time even though I was not feeling well. Justin sounded absolutely amazing throughout the whole of the show,his dances were perfect aswell as the dancers. He was having such a good time you could tell by the smile on his face throughout the whole show and the best part was that everyone went silent as soon as he started talked to show him we all respected him and what he had to say. I'll never forget when he made eye contact with me when I put down my phone and put my hands into a heart during purpose. It was the best night of my life and the most amazing 16th birthday present I could ever wish for. I love him so much and I can't wait to see him again. Xxxx ",
Justin Bieber,"Can anyone who haven't go to a Justin's concert write a comment?? My name is Diana, I'm 22 and I have never going to a Justin's concert!!! I just read all the previous comments and my tears just fell down... because the fact to see and meet Justin personally, is my biggest dream but I BELIEVE, I BELIEVE that one day I'm not going to write ''I haven't go'', the next comment will be ''I went to a Justin's'' Unfortunately, I didn't see Justin growing up during his tours, but I followed his entire life and now, I have among my stuffs a T-shirt of Purpose Tour and his perfume ''Someday''. It might sound crazy, but I have have times when I speak lonely, just preparing the time when I'll face Justin and imagine all the conversation, because I have to make true this phrase that it's only mine ''I WILL MEET YOU, OR I WILL'' and this will happen, that is a promess. And when that time running, I'll just tell him... my life is very completely now... I loved all the comments and I just grateful because I know my idol is a very loved person ",
Justin Bieber,"Seeing Justin Bieber perform live was one of the most fun times of my life. All of the lights, and videos/pictures that they put up on stage are amazing. Being able to be so close to a famous artist and hearing them perform is beyond incredible. Hearing his voice live and seeing him sing through all of his emotions is something that not a lot of people will get to experience. As well as singing Justin also will perform on the drums or piano in some of his songs. Not to mention he is also a great dancer on stage. Justin Bieber is great to see live, because you feel like he connects with every single person in the audience. He tries to make everyone laugh and smile and have a good time. He is very calm on stage, in front of thousands of screaming girls. All concerts, not only Justin Bieber concerts are fun times for anyone, no matter what age! Going to see someone sing and perform live is just incredible. I hope this interests you fans in seeing him live. You will have one of the best nights of your life at a Justin Bieber concert! ",
Justin Bieber,"The show was fantastic. Great sound, amazing lighting, talented musicians and dancers... even dazzling fireworks. However, the main character was not up to the show's standards. Bieber did not engage with his audience, did not smile once, did not put his heart in it. Screaming girls didn't notice that the object of their desire hardly sang... since they wet the ones singing each song by heart. His younger fans don't care if he shows that he doesn't enjoy his chosen line of work. Parents who ent with them think he should respect his public. If he is bored, he should study to be something else. On the other hand, the organization was pitiful. The guys showing people around did not know their way around. According to one of them a friend's row ""did not exist"", and to another, mine ""was nowhere tocbe found"". People were standing on the limpy chairs which made it hard for smaller children to watch the concert. In short, I would have rather stay home, and the show had no passion, but my kid's enthusiasm was worth it. ",
Justin Bieber,"Really disappointed in this show, we paid in excess of £700 for 4 tickets to take my two daughters to their first ever concert and I was disgusted how Justin spoke to his fans and threw his mic on the floor and stormed off stage! I've seen Adele and Coldplay this year who were both very down to earth, humble and appreciated their fans by the bucket load. Justin ought to take some tips from these far superior artists on how to work a crowd and show gratitude. Also not very impressed that Justin mimed to around 80% of the show, not even attempting to disguise the fact by being bothered to hold his mic to his mouth, as he's not a very energetic dancer out of breath most of the time I didn't see any reason for him to mime so much, the only thing I did notice was him floating around the stage on his massive ego the whole evening. I won't even be able to listen to his music after this. He really doesn't deserve his fans. ",
Justin Bieber,"Sunday, October 2nd I went to the Purpose World Tour Copenhagen in Telia Parken. I went to the show with my best friend and we had a really good time. When we arrived to Telia Parken, there was so many Beliebers, it was incredible. Well, we waited in line for the doors to open, and when the doors opened we went inside the Telia Parken. The stadium was huge. There was so many people in there. After the most people found their seats, the opening band came on. It was a band from UK/Liverpool, they were called Mic Lowkey. After a while the show finally started. Justin opened his show with his first song from his Purpose Album, Mark My Words. The audience were so turned up - when you looked over the stadium, there were lights from phones everywhere, it looked like stars, it was so beautiful. Well the show was incredible, Justin was in a good mood and the audience was awesome. So the show was amazing. ",
Justin Bieber,Justin did an amazing job last night. It was definitely an unforgettable experience. The staff was great and the whole vibe of the place was great. Justin did sprain his ankle but it was definitely not noticeable. He sang and danced his little heart out. I would love to go back. Moxie did amazing she has a beautiful voice and Post Malone really got the crowd going. Justin was phenomenal. I love him so much and I would love to get the chance to meet him someday. He poured his heart and soul into the performance. His voice is absolutely amazing. He did such a good job and I wish I could go back. The workers of the merchandise booths inside did a good job of keeping the lines moving fast. The booth outside had a very long line and a very slow line. Overall the experience was amazing and I will never forget it. ,
Justin Bieber,"Justin was amazing. That show was perfect. Justin was very nice to his fans. He danced and other stuffs and it was very funny. All time he was like yeah you're pretty cool people. It was an unforgettable day for his Beliebers. Justin was first time in Prague. Maybe that's the reason why fans were so loud and happy. I don't have words to say how much I love him. How much we love him. He is really good person. But media makes him worse. But he is actually very lovely person who loves his fans. His second family called ""Beliebers"" . We mean so much for him and I'm happy for that. And of course he means everything for us. I will never forget it. Because that day I've seen my biggest love in the world. Yeah, it was really great time. ",
Justin Bieber,"Great Concert! He was a great performer and the DJ and opening acts really pumped up the crowd! The 5 kids chosen to dance onstage were actually really good, and he even talked to them onstage! Must've been an amazing feeling for those lucky kids! He did almost all songs from his new album, and a couple of oldies such as ""Baby"" and ""As long as you love me"" which the whole crowd loved! During his hit song ""Company"", he did a bunch of tricks on a trampoline elevated from the stage! I recommend this concert to any age,but keep in mind, one of the opening acts ""Post Malone"" uses some pretty harsh language in his songs. Overall, a great experience! Bring about 100$ if you are planning to buy a sweater or shirt. ",
Justin Bieber,"The show was amazing! I loved the opening acts and of course Justin Bieber had performed perfectly. There were great vibes all around and fantastic vocals filling the stadium. There was a lot of love shown for Justin and from Justin to his fans. All the numbers were spectacular even with a little bit of stage difficulty. Justin was very down to earth and kind. His humor and personality lit up the arena. I would definetly rate it 100000/10 stars. For anyone debating if it is worth the cost, I would say it definetly is. Even being at the very top of the stadium would be worth it. I love Justin and I loved his show. I am definetly going to try and go again. ",
Justin Bieber,This isn't about my experience with Justin's concerts it is about me wanting to have an experience with justin bieber I wish he would come to Wisconsin so I could meet him Justin Bieber has helped me through the good and bad in life I don't know what I would do without him it would mean the world to me if I could just have the chance to met Justin Bieber money in my family is scarce so there is no way I could come and see Justin even if I wanted I hope my message gets out in the world and I could potentially meet Justin one day but probably will never happen thank you for taking the time to whoever reads this ,
Justin Bieber,"I went to go see Justin for the second time this weekend at the SAP Center in San Jose. He went above and beyond my expectations. The whole crowd seemed to be having an amazing time. The absolute best part of his performance was when he did his acoustic for Cold Water. I've never heard that much emotion being poured into a song and obviously, me being a Belieber for quite a while now, I shed some tears. There was a couple times throughout the show where he was smiling and laughing while dancing and he seemed to be having a genuinely good time. Overall, I would DEFINITELY go see Justin again! ",
Justin Bieber,"Went to see Justin back in 2013 and was a bit unsure about seeing him this time as even though I still love him I have grown up to like different kinds of music a bit more but I was absolutely blown away. Felt like my 15 year old self again, even got emotional when he sang at certain points. He came on and finished at the times said and was so sweet. He said he was feeling a bit under the weather and he still managed to put on a marvellous show. Loved absolutely every bit of it and I am more in love with him and his music as I ever have been!! ",
Justin Bieber,"I've experienced multiple concerts and shows in Palau Sant Jordi, and in my opinion this one was the best. I really like Justin's work and I enjoy listening to his music, but regarding JUST the concert and the preparation, I think everything was perfect and accurate. The dancers did an amazing work and also the special effects (such as the lights or the water during the final part) were incredible and made me feel surprised and amazed. I've enjoyed every detail during the show and I will remember it. ",
Justin Bieber,"The second show in Stockholm last night was as perfect as it could be. You can't notice that he has been on stage all around the world for more than 75 times this year. He does a really good show with that number of concerts in mind. The most powerful moment in Tele 2 Arena was when the whole crowd helpt him sing 'Love Yourself' and 'Life Is Worth Living'. You could feel the love in the air all around the arena. Nothing beats him, his guitar and his fans singing together as a unit. ",
Justin Bieber,"Over the years, I have been to many concerts but I have always wanted to go to Justin's concert. I attended the Nashville concert for the purpose tour. That was one of the best concerts I have ever seen, there was never a dull moment and you just kept wanting more. During the performances you can tell how dedicated Justin is to his performances and his fans. It was a night that I will never forget! I plan on getting tickets near the stage next time he comes close to my town. ",
Red Hot Chili Peppers,"The main show was great. BUT...... The forband was quite bad and dident bring the mood up, it was just awkward since I dont see how they play the same type of music as RHCP Other then that the security guards were simply asholes litterly taking thier power above and beyond any reason. I dont see how people that stand in the front baricade can get water. sure they had 1 guy with a water bottle coming back once an hour too give water to those he could REACH but one water bottle cant give 100-200 ppl water. There was ALOT of ppl feeling sick and had headaches. even one girl fainted. The guards conficated and took all water bottles and all food that we had in our backpack even if the waterbottles were empty. Not PET (plastic) bottles But exspensive sport bottles. Saying it SAYS so on the ticket and when I pointed out it IT DOES NOT he said we could had alchohol in it...IN A EMPTY WATER BOTTLE. (we emptied when they asked) then saying we could fill it with alchole inside. Why the fuck would anyone fill a water bottle with alchole inside the arena? there are TENS OF THOUSENDS plastic cups that decorates the floor of the arena after the show. and I bet it wasent water in them. I lost a very exspansive water bottle that I baught after climbing the highest mauntian in sweden. They are not easy to get, sinec I have to get there again if i want one for me this litterly made my entire show a massive headache after waiting for 9 hours for the show and just to get abused by security and then have a shit time with headache. why why why cant you have a waterbottle in a backpack. The price for a water bottle inside the arena was outragous 50 swedish KR for a small bottle...when tap water is free. And when I pointed out that it is swedish law that when serving alchole they are force to serve free water but they refused. IT makes me so fucking angry it ruin the entire experince. JUST LET PEOEPLE HAVE WATERBOTTLES and people would have a MUCH GREATER TIME. ",
Red Hot Chili Peppers,"As one of the best-selling bands of all time with seven Grammys under their belt, Red Hot Chili Peppers are still going strong 30 years on from their debut album, and their arena gigs are something that I really think everyone should try to experience. From their live performances in the late 80s early 90s, they have only maintained their energy and enthusiasm, demonstrating their dedication and drive has not dwindled with time, as their explosive lighting, and sound balances continue to please and excite their audience. Just last year at Big Day Out in Sydney, the Chili Peppers gave an electric performance of their globally acclaimed track 'Californication', contrasting this energy with their stunning classic 'Under The Bridge'. Their ability to transport the crowd from their ecstatic dancing enthusiasm into a sea of mellow phone holding, singing, dedicated followers is astounding, altering the mood of the fans flawlessly. There are few bands who have been able to continue such a fan base and following over such a span of time as the Chili Peppers have, and their continually expanding fan base are extremely well deserved. Seeing them in concert is a magical experience, one that I hope they will continue to provide, but if you get a chance, I seriously recommend that you try and catch a gig before you miss your chance. You are guaranteed a memorable performance. ",
Red Hot Chili Peppers,"Actually I was on the second show. The visual effects were awesome, but there were some audiotechnical issues what made Flea a bit upset. The band was so imprssive with full of energy. Especially Anthony and Flea, they were true showmen as always, however he missed the intro of Dark necessities so they had to restart and maybe I heard some missed vocal by Josh during the Snow. Moreover he changed the riff in the solo of Dani california, but as I saw that he can never run out of creative ideas. I liked the jamming parts ,once Flea and Josh played the intro of She lost control by Joy Division which was really nice to hear too. And also I've heard all of my favourite tracks by them. Personally Im a fan of the new album but I heard complains about the tracklist. Honestly I would start the show with Can't stop, but By the way was strong too and of course Give it away for the last song was an excellent choice. BUT! the real hero of the night was Chad f#ckin Smith who got a little injuriy but still finished the show. That would be perfect if he would played Can't stop :D All in all I loved the whole thing, I love all of their aeras, I respect Hill (r.i.p.) and my idol is John but they have to keep up and introduce the new crazy face of them. Thank you for that awesome adventure! ",
Red Hot Chili Peppers,"On June 22, 2017 the Red Hot Chili Peppers played the First Ontario Center in Hamilton, Canada. The Chilies are Rock and Roll Hall of Famers and they deliver every time. The same cannot be said for the opening acts. Jack Irons came out first and played a non-offensive drum and synthesizer set. It was very yawn worthy. This was followed by Deerhoof.  If you have never seen this four person band, your not missing anything. Their music is heavy on drums and guitar, who are both pretty good, but the vocals are terrible. The vocals remind me something Yoko Ono would have come up with in a drug induced haze. I have seen countless musical acts and I can say without a doubt Deerhoof is the worst ever. I actually got up a left the show for 30 minutes to escape the assault on my ears. If your going to see the Chili Peppers and you have seats, grab a few more beers and save your ears from the opening acts.  These opening acts drained the energy from arena and the Red Hot Chili Peppers would be better served to either find new opening acts or skipping opening acts all together and simply playing their set. The RHCP always deliver, but the opening acts failed. ",
Red Hot Chili Peppers,"The show was epic and totally rocked!  It was a hairy mess getting into and out of there, but well worth it.  It felt so great to be there, like being part of something important.  Seeing something that will be talked about for decades and hopefully broke down some barriers between cultures.  RHCP was spreading love and understanding and put on a fantastic show, which they also transmitted live to the world (which I think is unbelievably generous for a band of their stature to send out for free to everyone on the planet with an internet connection)!  I’ve been a long time fan but haven’t seen them since 1992 at Lollapalooza in Michigan.  Honestly, the band played better than ever matching or bettering the albums.  Anthony’s voice was absolutely perfect.  Chads drumming perfect, Fleas bass was stellar and energetic.  Joshs guitar tones were so very interesting I’ve spent hours since looking up on the internet all of his eqpt.  My wife and I will never forget the show and cant wait to see them again.  Oh yeah, the merch tables ran out of shirts so we bought some online. -Merk ",
Red Hot Chili Peppers,"Not much more to say that one third of my life goals were completed after seeing Anthony, Flea, Chad & Josh. It was almost undescribable but I'll do my best. From the first second when you could hear the horns playing and seeing them come up to the stage the adrenaline rush was dangerous. Everybody giving all they had since they first heard the first slam on the snare drums. The chemistry between all four reverberated across the whole audience and I felt like the people around me where my family. The acoustics were spot on amazing and the light show was jaw opening. Each song and jam was like having a different dream with the cosmic sounds they made and the expanding lights that danced around. The whole experience was one that I wish I could relive. When the band left before their encore, the community chants to bring them back filled my with patriotism and unity and once they came back to please the audience, they didn't disappoint. ",
Red Hot Chili Peppers,"I think that Red Hot Chili Peppers are really good to see in concert. This concert was reeeeaaaally funny i had really enjoy it !!! The songs of the group are really great and i love their music a lot. I enjoy the way that they play the song like ""give it away"", they sounds so much better than the music on CDs, there we can juste see the energie of the musician playing on the scene  its really joicefull. Flea is just amazing on the scene and the other players too. I've just one regret, just that  the group is coming to the scene  and didn't really comunicate with the public. The only moment when they talk to us was to say ""We love Paris,we love Parisian..."" and then they spoke too fast for french people  (lol) And they didn't say goodbye. Nevertheless this concert was my favourit, it was just amazing !!! I really think this is a group to see on a scene, a time in a life!!! ",
Red Hot Chili Peppers,"Hi ! It was the second time I saw the RHCP after 2012 & the show at ""Stade de France"". I'm pretty diappointed, not because of the show, it was awsome, but because of the behavior of the public. A few people hit me & my friends in the face because we were dancing around, having fun... telling us we where assholes when we were in front of them. As an answer, we apologized and moved somewhere else not to disturb them. But it was the same everywhere, peoples hit us, told we were cheaters and the ""we had not waited as long as them outside"".... how could they know... we apologised again, and went somewhere in a concert to dance without ""hurting"" anybody's emotions. I love the RHCP but this show will stay in my mind as the one I could not dance and appreciate the moment without being judje by the people around... With a lot of Pain, Me and my friends. ",
Red Hot Chili Peppers,"Although I had tried to get used to the idea that the band I was going to see had changed over the years, and had lost part of their spirit, I couldn't help to feel sad and nostalgic. The concert was great in general, and the musical performances in particular. Smith & Flea seemed devoted, as usual. Kiedis, not so much. I can't stop thinking that they've become a brand,that they got too comfortable. A product for masses, with those amazing visual effects. What I really disliked was the end of the concert. They ended it with one of the new songs (which I honestly hadn't even listened before) and they jumped out of the stage. Only Smith stayed to say ""muchas, muchas, muchas, muchas gracias"", goodness. It was worht it, just to listen to the good oldies, and see how they keep trying the pirouettes all over the stage. Still love them. ",
Red Hot Chili Peppers,"Really good concert! There some really great lights that hang from the ceiling and move up and down, as well as change colors depending on the mood of the song. I actually read somewhere that there's about 800 lights-the biggest in any tour ever. The visuals on the big screen behind the chili peppers are really cool too-basically the visuals are outstanding. Now on to what really matters; the music. The chili peppers (as you may have expected) deliver really high energy and fun songs through the concert, from old hits like ""suck my kiss"" to newer songs like""dark necessities"" the concert was really great and it seemed everyone had a good time. Highly recommend! ",
Red Hot Chili Peppers,"The Chili Peppers were everything I expected. Great sound, great energy, and great mechanical skill. The drum act from their first drummer was really fun too. Irontom or whatever their real opening act was was not worth watching though, and put a bit of a damper on the concert as a whole. I and my wife said several times that if it were a random show they were opening for we would have left after the first song, and in hindsight that was probably the best part of the set. We loved the main act, but if they found an opening act that didn't make me want to strike myself deaf and blind it would have made the whole concert better. ",
Red Hot Chili Peppers,"Honestly, the energy and vibe in the stadium was insane. Definitely, a memory to tell the grandkids in the future. They played 'Can't Stop' to start it off and that hyped the crowd and prepared us for what was to come. Although controversially they played some unknown old songs that for the die-hard fans might've enjoyed, it wasn't what people paid for. And a BIG downside was no 'Under the Bridge.' When would you ever go to an RHCP concert and not hear it? That was a major disappointment but overall i had a great night and the lad sitting next to me and even more so. Definitely would do it again. Thanks RHCP ",
Red Hot Chili Peppers,"This concert was amazing! My dad who has now been to seven RHCP-concert said that this was the best one yet. They played dark necessities, the getaway, go robot, goodbye angels and sick love from the new album. They also played classics like otherside, under the bridge, californication, dani california and blood sugar sex magik. Everything about the concert was simply amazing. The stage looked amazing as well with small lamps dropping up and down through out the concert. The foreband Deap Vally was amazing as well with an amazing feministic stage spirit and great songs. Can't wait to see them again! ",
Red Hot Chili Peppers,The Chili Pepper's rocked my world last night. It was a special moment when Anthony Kiedis came out to introduce Jack Irons for the opening performance. The Chili Pepper's not only surpassed my expectations but changed my life forever. I just want to see more and more of them. Last night they opened in my hometown and played Breaking The Girl for the first time since 2012. The entire night was amazing and I rocked out harder than anyone else at the AT&T center. (They should want to hire me as their front row chick). If you don't go and see the Getaway Tour you're missing out on life. ,
Red Hot Chili Peppers,"Spending the money to be right at the front was absolutely the right choice. This was such a high energy show. The crowd was engulfed in everything they dished up. Flea played all the right cards using his birth in Melbourne to have the crowd eating everything he threw out there. The three front of stage guys were a fire for the whole night while Chad was beating the skins like an olympic athlete, Higher Faster Stronger! That man is a machine!!!! If you are thinking, should I, Shouldn't I, Then I will decide fore you. GO AND GET A TICKET AND SEE THE SHOW. You will not be sorry! ",
Red Hot Chili Peppers,"Great psychedelic rock 'n' roll show!! Flea's bass solos never fail to amaze and the guitarist Josh gives his guitars a wicked Hendrix treatment. You can see Chad Smith's passion for drumming all the way, and of course, Kiedis hasn't lost his classic stage presence. Will the Chili Peppers ever run out of steam? Unlikely. Pretty much all the best songs (except Under The Bridge) were played, and they caught my interest with some of the new ""Gateway"" material as well. They also included a song they made in the 80s that I'll have to dig up now! ",
Red Hot Chili Peppers,"Setlist 10 Octubre 2017 - Palacio de los Deportes 1. Intro Jam 2. Around The Worlds 3. Snow ((Hey Oh)) 4. Scar Tissue 5. Dark Necessities 6.

Red Hot Chili Peppers,"The Sports Palace is not a good place to do concerts acoustically. Starting from that, just he sounded good. The setlist also left much to be desired. They missed big issues. We went on bike and had to leave the helmets in a makeshift tent as a dressing room. With the large size of the sports palace ... It could have enabled a place inside the building where you can leave our belongings safe. However, not everything was bad. We enjoyed everything we could concert despite these things. Hopefully I have been closer to the stage. ",
Red Hot Chili Peppers,"7/10 The instrumentals sounded fantastic. The vocals were decent, with lots of RHCP songs they require a lot of vocal range and Anthony hit most of them but I don't think he will have the touring tenure to go until he's in his 60's and will likely not be able to hit the notes in 10 years. The set list was decent but they left out a lot of favourites. That's ok with me but my biggest complaint was it was too short. 90 mins for the headliner was quite disappointing to say the least. But all in all the music was fantastic so 7/10. ",
Calvin Harris,"Calvin Harris is an artist atop of his game at the moment. Having released a record breaking album in the form of '18 Months' where every single lifted became an instant hit on both sides of the Atlantic, the Scottish DJ has quite a feat of creating a live show to match his accreditation. Luckily, armed with four albums worth of A-game material he has no trouble in performing a mammoth 36 song set. His own personal hits including 'Bounce', 'I Need Your Love' and 'Under Control' featuring Kelis, Ellie Goulding and Hurts whip the crowd into early frenzy before he is also able to unleash wave after wave of collaborative efforts. These include global hit with Rihanna, 'We Found Love' as well as the triple threat collaboration with Florence + the Machine as he plays 'Spectrum', 'You've Got The Love' and 'Sweet Nothing'. One of his earliest hits from '18 Months' does not feature an A-list guest feature, 'We'll Be Coming Back' achieves roars from the crowd as the mass raving and dancing continues below the DJ's stage. As the final reverberated notes of 'Summer' fade, the streamers land and the lights dim the audience leave having experienced a world-class dance party. ",
Calvin Harris,"Let me start by saying I’m not even that into EDM. But going to see Calvin Harris is an experience in itself. Yes, you will hear songs you know. Yes, you will feel the bass flood through your body. And yes, you will absolutely dance your ass off. I went into this show thinking I’d have to suffer through a few hours of the same electronic beat drops we’ve come to know, getting shoved up against some ravers who didn’t realize I was even standing there. How wrong I was! From the moment the show opened, with every special effect known to man; streamers, lasers, strobes, smoke, moving platforms; until the finale, I was transported to another dimension where I couldn’t stop moving my feet.   The music was varied enough to keep my attention, but similar enough that I knew most of the songs. The people in the crowd were happy, smiling, and friendly. It’s definitely an experience that I’m glad I didn’t miss out on and I’m looking forward to the next time he comes around as I’ll definitely be purchasing a ticket to his show as well as convincing any friends of mine that they would be dumb not to join. ",
Calvin Harris,"From the moment that the lights shone from the stage right till the end, Calvin Harris's performance was live! The lighting effects were crazy and added to the amazing set he had. He really knows how to work a crowd and had everyone on their feet and jumping making the atmosphere just how you want it to be at a live concert. I saw him when he was the opening act for Rihanna and can safely say that he was just as good as her.    Each song he played was well known and his mixes were amazing. If you're looking for a party, then he is the best DJ you could ask for out there...    Knows how to work a crowd, plays good music and has the best light display which all equates to an awesome night out and best DJ ever! Recommend to anyone. ",
Calvin Harris,Well what a way to bring in 2016 with Calvin Harris at omnia Vegas I've saw him before but OMG he was outstanding playing some of the best tunes outside how deep is your love summer and much more a set of over 2hrs was well worth the money omnia it's self is truly amazing the lights the moving chandelier outstanding just made the set even better highly recommend I will be back in Vegas and omnia to see Calvin again Amazeballs x ,
Calvin Harris,Love Calvin but Omnia is super crowded so it's tough to see him. I feel his set was a little too crowd pleasing but overall it was decent. Omnia has an incredible centerpiece that is the biggest attraction besides the talent. ,
Calvin Harris,"Brillante ! But overbooked , can't enjoy with such a amount of people, came from another country for the event and despite of the effort to enjoy Omnia was packed , sell less , make people enjoy more .. ",
Calvin Harris,"Great show. I would have loved more of their songs and less remixes, but I enjoy it. ",
Kendrick Lamar,"An all around great show. Dram and YG were impressive opening acts, even tho the crowd was a bit dead until Kendrick showed up. YG played ""Fuck Donald Trump"" which was preceded by a Trump impersonator and was genuinely really surprising and hilarious. Once Kendrick showed up, every seat was filled, it was chaotic, and there was a hell of a lot of screaming. Right before he ascended onto the stage from the little platform in the middle of the stage- which was exactly on time, I should add- there was a really cool showing of this ninja performance, as well as a story-like, cinematic, short where he battled someone, and funny title screens showed up from time to time saying phrases like ""KENDRICK FUCKS SHIT UP"". Similar clips were shown sporadically throughout the show so the crowd wouldn't get bored as they prepared for different parts of the act. It was cool when he got raised on this platform in the middle of the arena to perform ""Money Tree"", but the most beautiful part of the show was definitely when he played ""LOVE."" and just about every person had their phone's flashlights on, swaying side to side, chanting, ""love me."" It was stunning. Probably the wildest time, for me, was when he played ""Alright,"" near the end. That song is really emotional for me, and seeing him play it live was magnificent. Not to mention how, just like with every other song, so many other people were shouting the lyrics, words for word. Afterwards, there was ""HUMBLE."" which Kendrick made the crowd sing the entirety of. It was then played a second time, where he sung along, and then descended back underneath the stage. Lots of people thought it was over, but some friends and I had checked the set-list and knew to stay put. Soon enough, he was right back on stage, and played the final song, ""GOD."" It wasn't quite as strong of a finish as 'HUMBLE."" but was nonetheless an undoubtedly great song. If I could, I would experience it all over again, minus the ear ringing that lasted until the middle of the next day, a near loss of voice, and needing to skip the next day of school. Another highlight was seeing the uncomfortable white parents who brought their kids. It was amusing to watch them try to dance, shout-out to those guys. One dad brought this, like, eight year old kid who covered her ears when we screamed (understandable considering how ear-piercing it was, but still), and sat down except for when ""HUMBLE."" was playing. The dad was on his phone the entire time, though. It was amusing, the concert as a whole was unbelievably fun, I hope anyone who gets to see Kung Fu Kenny at some point has a hell of a good time. Heads up: they may not have the merch you want in your size or even at all, but they have other things that are just as good. Also, eat before you go, the lines are crazy long and the food way is too expensive. Anyway, have a blast, don't say the n-word if you're not black. Thank you. ",
Kendrick Lamar,"Photo Gallery Here: http://alexsandalis.com/kendrick-lamar-photo-gallery/ Amazing performance by Kendrick. His energy was great and he interacted with the sold out crowd making eye contact and listening to their screams and yells every chance he got. Started off by teasing the crowd going back and forth to the mic and eventually starting with For Free, spitting bar after bar. Best moment of the show was Alright / M.A.A.D City and definitely finishing with ADHD after he gauged the audiences reactions to him calling out all his albums he could see Section.80 was big for the crowd. After he noticed a small group of people in the front row rapping a song from Untitled Unmastered we all started calling out songs to do from the album. Calling out “2” and “7” putting our fingers up as Kendrick looked at us contemplating whether he should do it for a good minute. A chant broke out for “We Gon’ Be Alright’ and then he played “Alright”. A part of me still thinks if they didn’t start chanting that he would’ve gone into one of the songs. Only critique was the sound. From the front row the vocals were heavily drowning out by the live instrumentals so much so it took me 20-30 seconds before realising what song it was sometimes. Not all songs, ADHD was the most easily heard because they didn’t use as much heavy instrumentation. But the problem wasn’t throughout the whole stadium as I talked to those in seats they couldn’t relate to it sounding like that. It was disappointing not to see there wasn’t an emphasis on visual display for his Australia tour like previous performances in the US, but it seemed like it was just about Kendrick, his band and straight music. Also, never seen so many people have to be carried out by security guards over the barrier because they were hurt/passing out. Also saw one big guy walk being escorted through the barrier with half his face covered in blood from the corner of his eye. Kendrick fans don’t play. He ended up finishing with ‘I Am’ off his Kendrick Lamar EP which is above. ",
Kendrick Lamar,"I saw Kendrick Lamar on day two of Lollapalooza last summer. This was probably one of the craziest concerts I've been to, but I loved every minute of it! There was a special opportunity to meet the man himself before his concert, but my friends and I did not get there in time. The only other way to meet him was to each pay for a CD. We ended up deciding to wait for the concert that was going on before Kendrick to finish then try to get good spots. We thought the crowd would disperse after that concert, so it would be pretty easy to get close to the front. But, boy, were we wrong. Either everyone was thinking the same thing as us, or the crowd was staying for Kendrick - it was the most claustrophobic, sweaty, aggressive struggle to the front of the crowd I've ever experienced. My friends and I were forced to stand smushed against random people for forty minutes. I don't even know how we made it to a couple of rows from the front, but we eventually did. After what seemed to be like the longest, stuffiest forty minutes of my life, Kendrick finally came on. He started out with ""Fucking Problems,"" and the crowd went CRAZY! We were nonstop jostling the whole time. Kendrick is so on point live! Even though I was taken aback at first by how his voice did not sound the same as his audio tracks, he still was amazing. He challenged us to see if we all could keep up with him when he rapped. He knew how to keep the energy up the whole time. One of the most memorable moments in Kendrick's show was when he completely stopped in the middle of a song and pointed out to a spot in the crowd where a man in a wheelchair was crowd surfing. Kendrick commended the people that helped the man surf through the crowd while he was passed to the front over the crowd. It was a really cool moment to witness. Only places like Lolla would something like that happen, and I'm happy that I could see Kendrick how I did, all the craziness included. ",
Kendrick Lamar,"I have always been an avid fan of Kendrick Lamar ever since his album ""Section .80"". He just has a way to capture your emotions because he raps the truth. As much as that sounds really corny, I think one would understand where I'm coming from if you saw him live. I had the privilege to see Kendrick Lamar front row at Fuji Rock Festival 2013 last summer. I'm not sure if this is the case for many of his shows but he came on a little later than expected. Despite that, he really pulled a great show and tried his best to make up for the time lost although he could've sung more if he came on earlier. Anyways, regardless I think what made Kendrick special was that other than lighting, some fog, and a few guys playing the beats for his songs with guitars and drums, it was really just him standing alone on stage rapping. I remember standing out and just really feeling the vibes while Kendrick stood in the spotlight surrounded by this dim purple lighting, melodically rapping and being slowly creeped on by some fog on a chilly summer night up in the mountains. It was actually quite mystical. Many Japanese fans seemed to love ""Backseat Freestyle"" and  ""Money Trees"", as I felt more pushing from the crowd during those songs. Of course he also rapped ""Bitch Don't Kill My Vibe"", ""The Recipe"", ""Swimming Pools"", and his best songs in ""good kid, mad city"". One surprise during this concert was he also rapped ""Fucking Problems"" which was a huge hit for everyone and that was lots of fun. The concert was overall so good and worth being pushed around while I clung onto my spot in the front because Kendrick blew a kiss at my direction after I yelled out his name! ",
Kendrick Lamar,"Overall I left the show pretty happy and satisfied, thought there were a few problems. To get the negatives out of the way, Travis Scott, one of the openers set to perform, didn't. The entire concert was interrupted with an intermission over an hour long due to Travis's absence, which really halted the momentum of the event. Another negative was that they played SZA's latest album ""Ctrl"" around 3 times in full between the opening set up and various intermissions. Even if you love this album, hearing the same songs repeatedly can get old quick. I would have much preferred if they mixed it up a bit, and at least play music from other TDE artist in addition to SZA's album. Besides that the show was great though. DRAM did a pretty nice job with his brief set. He sounded great live, very close to how he sounds in his recordings, and the images he had flashing behind him created a fun atmosphere. And once Kendrick came out and performed, it was fantastic. He performed a variety of songs, mainly from DAMN. as well as a few off of GKMC, TPAB, and UU. He was energetic throughout the performance, constantly moving, and engaged the audience, encouraging a hype atmosphere. The best part was easily during humble, when the crowd finished out one of the verses and the chorus together; it was truly communal. Due to our excitement Kendrick performed an encore with the song YAH. Overall I'd recommend going to the concert if you're a fan of Kendrick Lamar, or hip-hop shows in general. I had a great time, even with some gripes, and would gladly experience it again. ",
Kendrick Lamar,"I’ve been to see many big rap artists including Jay Z, Kanye West, ASAP Rocky and even Eminem.... But Kendrick stepped up the game. The set list set out a journey that had the whole place shaking from start to finish. The SSE arena managed capture all this energy and let it simmer around for everyone to feed off throughout the whole because every man/woman yout and old were bouncing like they were trying to bring the place down. Kendrick Lamar is no doubt a rap genius and probably the biggest in the world right now. The DAMN tour took us through the Kung Fu Kenny journey with amazing video graphics during short intermissions between songs as intros and gave enough storyline to the attendees to be enraptured by this and gas the whole crowd up for each moment! It’s hard to pin one moment down but when the whole crowd started singing Humble twice over without the help of Kendrick for then him to come out and say this has got to be the best show yet.... man, I had goosebumps and was ready to stomp. 12/10.... worth every penny and more. Thank you Kendrick! ",
Kendrick Lamar,"Kenrick Lamar is considered to be one of the most exciting new artists on the US hip hop scene. He has amassed a cult following over the years and now with new support on both sides of the pond, Lamar is packing out venues and festival tents at a staggering rate. Rapturous cheers go up as Kendrick confidently appears onstage and takes the whole scene within his stride as the bass pierces the crowd and he begins 'Money Trees'. His freestyle ability demonstrates just why he has so much critical acclaim, he is undoubtedly a talented rap artist. Breakthrough single 'Swimming Pools' gets a deafening reaction as it has become a cult hit over a relatively short amount of time. Kendrick capitalises on this as he invites the audiences into a back and forth of 'Pass Out... Drank'. 'Bitch Don't Kill My Vibe' also goes down incredibly well, the audience seemingly knowing every rap and verse. He reappears for 'A.D.H.D' visibly happy with the set and the crowd, it will be interesting to see where he will take his sound and show next. ",
Kendrick Lamar,"I was sitting in the front on a chiar and once travis scott came up, he called everyone next to the stage and the crowd went crazy and it was chaotic. Everyone from the back seats came all the way to the front and everyone climbed on the chairs and it was hard to see anything. The security tried to get people back to their seats but they did not suceed. I thought it was unfair because i paid a lot of money to stay in front and the ones who had their seats in the back got to pay less but still get to stay in the very front. Also, everyone was high and drunk. The guy in front of me fell off his chair and spilled a whole cup of beer all over me and the 3 people next to me. I do not recommend paying for a seat right in front of the stage because everyone from behind will come in front anyways. Overall, the concert was not well organized since the secrity could not get people to their seats, but, the actual performance by kendrick lamar was a good one and he was able to keep everyone entertained. ",
Kendrick Lamar,"I knew of Kendrick Lamar, but my friend (forcibly) made me go to his concert with her. At first, I wasn't so keen on it since I knew only a few songs. However, when he came on and stalled time - causing suspense - I already knew it was going to be an awesome night, to which it was. If I had known his songs more, I would have enjoyed it just as much as my friend had. He had the whole arena by his hands. The crowd sang with him, jumped when he said so and lit up the darkened stadium with their flashlights within 5 seconds. It was definitely a concert that Kendrick has managed to etch it into my mind, and obviously introduced me to his unique music. ",
Kendrick Lamar,"Coming into the show was difficult because it was so packed.  I had just visited excel energy a few weeks prior to the Kendrick Lamar concert and I have to say I was more impressed with the J Cole concert the weeks prior.  I am not sure if it was because of the hype of the crowd or just where I was sitting.  I had a great time, it just didn't seem like a lot of the people around me felt the same.  Kendrick was a great performer and I could tell he put all of his energy into the show.  Maybe next time not have it be an all ages show. That could have been the reason for a less hype crowd. ",
Kendrick Lamar,"Describing the showmanship of Kendrick Lamar is tough, and I'm not really sure where to start. He played song from all his albums. He made a movie to tell a story thru his set. He had lights, lasers, explosions, Kung Fu fighters, a dude with a damn sword, and Travis Scott rode on an eagle. I'm not real big on Scott do that was the highlight for me. DRAM's set could have been longer it felt like only 15 minutes. However, Kendrick's almost hour and a half set made the few bumps worth it. I cannot recommend a Kendrick show more.The GOAT. ",
Kendrick Lamar,"It was the first time i was at a Kendrick Lamar concert and i was totally happy with it! He had crazy energy, he was in a good mood , talked with the audience and he sang with his heart!! We left the arena hyped and totally satisfied. One thing i didn't like was the opening act.And as i noticed from the people sitting around me i am not the only one that felt this way. I am sure that James Blake is really amazing and one of the best at his genre but I d like someone else that also raps to have opened for Lamar. ",
Kendrick Lamar,"My girlfriend and I did not get to see the opening act because we were not really interested; however, Kendrick Lamar's show was one of the best, if not, the best Hip Hop concert I ever been in my life so far.  The production was incredible, the sound was perfect, and his performance was priceless.  Kendrick Lamar is the most talented Hip Hop artist of this decade and is a master of his craft.  An amazing performance of epic proportions in the Hip Hop world.  Highly recommend it to anyone. ",
Kendrick Lamar,My friend and I sat in traffic for 2 hours so we missed most of the concert. When Kendrick was on. Half the time he had the crowd singing and had audio of his voice instead of rapping all the time. This was the earliest end to a concert I’ve ever been to and I had to sit for another hour of traffic to get out of this venue. Could’ve been great if SZA had actually performed. I’m just disappointed and I don’t care if Kendrick comes back I’m not wasting my money or time again. ,
Kendrick Lamar,"I been listening to Kendrick for a few years now and I remember telling people in school that he was gonna be making a big sound in hip hop. I been at all his concerts in mass and I will see every one that he comes for its awesome to see a legend in my own time and being able to say that I saw it be for it happened. im not gonna argue with people with what im about to say but, he is the tupac of our time.... I will be at his concert  here http://kendricklamar.haltelavaltrie.com ",
Kendrick Lamar,"Great stage show ruined by the worst sound of any concert I've ever attended. I was so pumped to see my favorite current rapper, only to be let down by a tidal wave of so much reverb that it was hard to recognize most songs much less understand a single word Kendrick said all night. The first 2 acts sounded great. I don't know what possessed these guys to drown Kendrick Lamar in such an extreme amount of reverb. He sounded like he was playing in a cave. So disappointing. ",
Kendrick Lamar,"Kung Fu Kenny! Legendary performance from one of the most poignant and powerful rap artists around! Kendrick didn't dissapointed as he reeled out all the tracks from the DAMN album, and surprising us with classics from his sophomore and follow up album! The energy was incredible and the crowd were wild for him! I would definitely go to see him again. His presence on political/racial/edgy topics make him stand out from the crowd! A must see performance! ",
Kendrick Lamar,"What an amazing show! The theme was really amazing and it was unbelievable to see artists like Kendrick and SZA in the flesh. The Top Dawg crew is worth seeing; it was well worth my 50 bucks. One gripe I had was that SZA didn't come back out to sing All the Stars with Kendrick (I think it's because after she finished her set she had to be flown to the Met Gala, lol) BUT that would've been the cherry on top. Besides that..truly iconic and legendary! ",
Kendrick Lamar,"Kendrick really showed last night. Playing everything from his untitled album to Damn. At one point the whole crowd was signing all of Humble acapella. My only complaint though is that SZA didn’t show. It honestly felt like the heart of the show was missing, and I knew it was because SZA was off the tour. Wish she woulda announced it before I drove 2 hours to see her :/// anyway get well soon SZA ",
Kendrick Lamar,"The Kendrick Lamar was fantastic! If felt like, I was in a execise class! It's was the first rap show, that I have attended! It's has taken Kendrick Lamar, to get to four albums, to be concerned a great artist! The atmosphere in audiences, good! I think, this may due, to the that it's was mainly a young crowd! I travel, from east London, to come to Wembley & I would definitely do it again. ",
Nicki Minaj,"This was my first large-venue concert. I was skeptical at first because I've grown used to the small places in the PNW, but it's Nicki and she's in my hometown so of course it's worth it. She's not gonna be doing a show at some hipster coffee place. 4 stars. Nicki is amazing. She fixed a girl's nip slip without embarrassing about it. She gave us all life advice. She did most of the songs off the Pinkprint. Some were full length songs and some were just 1-2 minute snippets. Some people weren't happy about that, but honestly I think the snippets were totally fine. The song usually repeats anyways and 1-2 minutes of it gets to the point. She really maximized the amount of songs by doing that. The second half of the show she mostly did lines from songs she's been featured in and pop quizzed the audience. She brought out Rae Sremmurd for Thro Sum Mo', which was actually pretty fun, and ended on a high note...Starships/The Night is Still Young. TL;DR, she's a frigging peach. The opening acts were pretty good. Tinashe was great, Rae Sremmurd isn't my thing but they got the crowd hyped. Maybe it's because I missed most of Tinashe and she went first, but I don't recall ever seeing Dej Loaf. Oh well. What kind of sucked is that the opening acts weren't displayed on the two side screens, so I really had no idea what was going on. Some semi negative things were the venue. I mean, it was great that there was free parking, but it was kind of messy. No safe walkways for pedestrians walking from lot to the ampitheatre. Also, the guy in front of me kept lighting up. If you don't like the smell of weed and cigs, don't go. Another thing I didn't like was Meek Mill doing his set right in the middle of Nicki's set. I screamed a lot of stuff about Drake during that time. Fight me. Overall, Queen Onika 4 Life. ",
Nicki Minaj,"The Nicki Minaj show In Chula Vista, California was amazing! I saw the ""same"" show at the Staples Center in Los Angeles in late June. Rumor on the block was that the show at Staples Center was toned down due to it being a concert surrounding The BET Awards Weekend Events. The word on the street was TRUE. Nicki's performance at the outdoor venue outside of San Diego was more than fun and fantastic, it was breath-taking and jaw-dropping. Nicki had an electric energy that just filled you with awe. Her smile was alive, contagious, and sweet. I found myself entertained by her silly antics when reverting back to songs from the beginning of her hip hop plight. Then the Mood changed to an upbeat dance tempo, and I found myself jumping up and down, and singing every word to her recent hit, 'Truffle Butter' from the most recent ""Pink Print"" album. More emotion was pulled from me when I found myself fighting back tears during her latest love ballad, 'Grand Piano'. With countless hit records, and her sensational stage presence, Lil Wayne knew she was a star in the making when he heard her mixtape in 2009. Nicki, I will never forget the musical talent you expressed that mid-August night at the Sleeptrain Amphitheater in Chula Vista, California. It was definitely, 'A MOMENT 4 LIFE' that I will never forget! Three minor questions though: 1) Where was the costume with the feathered headdress that you promoted for the tour? 2) Where was Trey Songs? 3) Why Meek Mill??? Still LOVE YOU though Nicki!!!! Nikki Renee Moorpark, CA August 2015 ",
Nicki Minaj,"'Can’t you hear that boom, badoom, boom boom, badoom, boom bass’…if you can’t then you’re missing out! Nicki Minaj’s catch pop rap tunes are sure to get you dancing and in the mood for a party, even just on recordings, let alone live. It’s difficult to go too far without hearing on of Minaj’s incredibly successful tracks blasting out, which isn’t surprising since she became the first female artist to have seven singles simultaneously charting on the Billboard Hot 100. Her sometimes-questionable language is pushed aside out of question by her extravagant costume and staging choices. Her ‘Pink Friday’ tour saw the show opening to a neon lit throne out of which Minaj bounces energetically, buzzing to begin her performance. The energy she radiates is undeniable, and her enthusiasm permeates into the crowd with her infectious smile reaching even the most reluctant audience members. Her performances are all about having fun, having a good time, and consequently, the audience thoroughly enjoy themselves, jumping along to the well known songs of the moment. Minaj has a reputation for her wild side, bringing chaos to many shows, but her music enables this flamboyant nature to function positively in a performance environment, engaging and catering for an audience who just want to have a great time…something it seems she can guarantee! ",
Nicki Minaj,"It's only mid-March and I can already state without a doubt this was the worst show of the year! Ms Minaj didn't sing. Didn't even try to lip-sync. Over the entire concert she probably pretended to lip-sync 4 or 5 minutes, not more. In between she actually muttered/wrapped a couple of sentences, rather annoyingly interrupting and asking some stupid “put your hands up” deejay to play another song. She invited 5 other artists on stage, but each left a sub-par impression, wrapping a handful of sentences, no passion whatsoever, then strutting or dancing around the stage. Usually when life singing is not an artist's strong suit, they try to put on a bit of a show. While Nicki’s show started promising with a unicorn background, there really was no follow-up. Quite a boring affair. She arrived late on stage and there were annoyingly long breaks in between. There was no flow at all. Not sure if that was because she was stoned (like in her Brussels’ show the week before) or whether she totally didn’t care. Summary: worst show of the year. Only positives were that the tickets were half-priced, and at least the audience tried to sing a bit. ",
Nicki Minaj,"Nicki Minaj. A global superstar who has risen from the underground via Young Money in a relatively short amount of time yet has been continuously writing, releasing and collaborating with huge acts in the industry. Her live show is now a melange of theatrics, freestyle and character driven acts as she often teeters between her hip-hop routes for the likes of covers by 2 Chainz and Gyptian to the alter-ego Roman as she plays 'Roman Reloaded' and 'Roman Holiday'. She has also features a number of worldwide hit singles with her own brand of dance/pop so one act is made up of 'Turn Me On', 'Pound The Alarm' and 'Superbass' which makes for mass dance-along in her audience. Remaining continuously charismatic throughout her long set, Nicki completes detailed choreographed routines with her dancers and wows the audiences with her freestyle ability. There is a good balance in her sets between the material that has made her a household name ('Starships', 'Right Thru Me') with the material that first gained her attention from the underground scene ('Itty Bitty Piggy', 'Freedom'). Despite the diva reputation, Nicki is an artist dedicated to her music. ",
Nicki Minaj,"The show was great, it was a delight to see the queen of hip hop live! Nicki was awesome on stage, very energetic, showing off all of her talent and with a very good connection to her fans (she even got two persons from the public on stage). I was screaming and dancing all along the show and had a great time. However, I -as a big fan- was a little bit disappointed on the following points: Trigga's show was a little bit too long and Nicki's one was too short. Nicki sang for 1 hour 40 mins, but she didn't sing some hits that I would have liked to hear and would have been perfect to make a 2 hour long show, such as HOV Lane, I Am Your Leader, Four Door Aventador, Bed Of Lies, and Get On Your Knees. I admit that as I left the building I didn't feel 100% satisfied, I wanted more Nicki! ",
Nicki Minaj,"I think that the show was great and very spectacular, but it was the exact same as every other show of this tour. I was expecting something more personal, that only us would get to experience, not only changing her lyrics to ""Belgium won't you save me"" which was already so sweet, but we know that she does the same everywhere else. Also the crowd honestly wasn't the best. I wanted to jump and shout all the time but I always was alone. The people around were so still and kind of disrespectful during the opening act and during Juice WRLD's performance, they could've at least showed a bit of interest even if they don't like their music. But Nicki was extraordinary as she has always been, even if she was 1 hour late it was worth it. ",
Nicki Minaj,"Nicki Minaj 'The PinkPrint Tour' at the hydro arena GLASGOW on April 12th 2014 was amazing, a night to remember. nicki Minaj performance was fantastic, the fans were going crazy for her. She is an excellent entertainer, I've seen her once before when she hosted the mtv ema music awards at the hydro also and she couldn't have done a better job. Love her!! Hope to see her again next year!! ",

Nicki Minaj,Loved it the atmosphere was amazing Nicki was amazing and we enjoyed Trey Songz too. I cannot wait until she is back. The que was long but moved quickly and we were standing and had enough space once we'd moved to the side. She performed my favroite songs and really entertained everyone. Excellent night xx ,
Nicki Minaj,"So Nicki, Y the Atl,Ga. Not on your Tour???? We love u also in da ATL Add us to ur Tour ???? Sooooon??? Come Party with us Lil Wayne comes here & have fun ""Turn up n Show out in da ATL,Ga???"" Hope you come on da invite to Link up As though u say in ur song Love from da Atl,Ga.. ",
Nicki Minaj,Nicki was absolutely incredible!!! She put on such a show and I hope she comes back again soon. She was so enthusiastic and really knows how to wow a crowd. Her dancers were lovely enough to come down and take photos with me after the show! It was such an amazing night. Thank you Nicki xx ,
Nicki Minaj,"Most incredible concert I've ever been to! You can see how much Nicki cares about her fans and her entire team, her dancers, and Trey Songz did an incredible job - but Nicki's performances were definitely the highlight of the night! Can't wait to go again for her next European tour!!! ",
Nicki Minaj,"The absolute, best show I've been to. Her performance, her wardrobe, her stage presence were better than I could've guessed. I already didn't think there was any way I could love Nicki M even more, but I was definitely proven wrong. Much love from the A, Onika<3 ",
Nicki Minaj,Was really engaging and lit asf. :) Definitely recommend. Need 30 words for review so: Potato Potato Potato Potato Potato Potato Potato Potato Potato Potato Potato Potato Potato Potato Potato Potato Potato Potato Potato Potato Potato Potato Potato Potato ,
Nicki Minaj,"FUCKING AMAZING. SHE IS INCREDIBLE. WORTH EVERY SINGLE PENNY. She has such amazing energy on stage. She really knows how to act and connect to the audience. It was too bad though that Globen wasn't full, there was alot of free space at the dancefloor. ",
Nicki Minaj,"The show was unbelievable! Nicki was flawless as I expected, and everyone was so happy to see her. I just think that she wasn't really interacting with us, I felt like she didn't actually care about Belgium. The show was kind ",
Nicki Minaj,"It was AMAZING ! I loved it, I had the time of my life at this show. Nicki was beautiful ! She was perfect. The way she entered on the stage was mind-blowing . She has the crown and she deserves it. Queen Nicki forever. ",
Chris Brown,"I was very excited to see ""Chris Brown Performing Live"", as the tickets stated while purchasing. Once I was at the venue, the overall ambience was nice and seemed promising. The opening performers added hype to the night by repeating, ""Who is ready for Chris Brown?"" As the clock ticked away and Chris Brown never appeared, my self, my guest, and those around me grew more and more upset and antsy. Everyone was questioning where the main act, Chris Brown, was. At around 1:30 AM, it became apparent that Chris Brown was not going to show. The stage filled with talentless acts taking snapchats and acting foolish. No one cared about these people, and the crowd turned sour. At around 1:40AM, they played a Chris Brown music video, which, again, no one cared about. We were all there to see ""Chris Brown Performing Life"", once again, as the tickets stated. Finally, as if trying to pull wool over the attendees eyes, a fool on stage announced, ""Are you all having fun? This was a Chris Brown video release party."" As soon and myself and many others heard that, we had complete affirmity that Chris Brown was a no-show. Living in Orange County, it was quite a drive getting to Downtown Los Angeles, and parking wasn't cheap. I would have appreciated the knowledge of Chris Browns lack of presence as soon as they venue/ performers/ respective people knew. I am very displeased with the unprofessionalism and the offended by the act of lying to the crowd. This experience will influence whether or not I choose to purchase tickets from SongKick or the Belasco Theater again. ",
Chris Brown,This concert was without a doubt one hell of a nite!!! The opening acts were awesome already. They started unbelievably punctual and created a great atmosphere. My personal favorite of them was August Alsina who really got the party going when he entered the stage with his song Numb. The main show was just awesome. Chris Brown performed both some of his older songs as well as the ones on his latest album. He showed off his great dancing skills and made every single girl in the audience go crazy by pulling up his shirt and showing us his six pack. Towards the end of the concert some of the supporting acts entered the stage and performed with him which was just so fun to watch. When the show was over I was just so sweaty and my feet and cheeks hurt from constantly dancing and smiling. I was incredibly thirsty but even for that the event organizer had an awesome solution. They gave away Coke and Coke Zero cans at the entrance FOR FREE which was just the best idea ever. I had never experienced a concert that was that organized and well-conceived before. All in all it was an awesome night and I'd recommend attending a Chris Brown concert to everybody who likes this kind of music and just wants to have a good time. As I already said it was ONE HELL IF A NITE! ,
Chris Brown,"Quite a few years of bad press and some very public run ins with the law have meant that Chris Brown has lost some of his credibility as an artist. It seems that many have forgotten that since the age of 16, he has provided us with some of the biggest RnB and Hip-Hop hits of the last decade. Though chances to see him live now may be few and far between, any chance that you get, you should take it! Seeing Chris at the Indigo2 in 2009 was one of my best concert experiences ever, hands-down. Just 19 years old at the time, he commanded the stage and the audience with a presence far wiser than his years. His expert dance moves and voice to match have drawn comparisons to some of the biggest artists such as Michael Jackson and Justin Timberlake. As he made his way though a string of hits, including ‘With You’, ‘Wall to Wall’ and ‘Run It’, the energy in the room never slumped, a testament to the quality of both his music and performance. Some very unfortunate incidents have left Chris Brown with a much-scarred public persona. Seeing him live is a chance to see him at his best, as an artist. ",
Chris Brown,"It is fair to say that Chris Brown has become more well known for the negative press that has surrounded him and less so for his work as an R & B artist over the past few years. It would also be fair to say he has lost credibility as an artist and a number of his fan base has left him during the controversy. Although, that is not to say that Chris has given up on music and still endeavours to wow crowds with his R & B/pop and international hits. Beginning his set with a barrage of stage lights and pyrotechnics, the intro to 'Beautiful People' begins to play out around the arena and the crowd cheer from below. Perhaps acknowledging his past mistakes halfway through the set or simply adding a note of controversy, Chris performs his remix of Rihanna's 'Birthday Cake'. His set is not completely focused on hits, he picks some of his personal favourite work including '2012' and 'Biggest Fan' which receive good reaction from the audience. The biggest cheer of the night though is undoubtedly for set closer and international hit 'Turn Up The Music'. ",
Chris Brown,"I haven’t used this app yet but i just wanted to share my experience at Chris Brown’s concert. He’s AMAZING with all capital words. I’m not going to say he’s the best, but he is for me. Chris has something special, I love him and all he does from the bottom of my heart. I wish I could meet him someday and maybe possibly work with him and show him what I got and the same way i’m proud of him and i appreciate what he does, i would love him to see that on me. I don’t know I just feel like he’s my dad. I’ve never felt this way with any other celebrity but Chris is from another planet. He’s absolutely talented. You ALL need to go to one of his concert at least once. ",

Chris Brown,"i saw the show at the SAP center in San Jose. i was VERY upset with the stage set up.  i paid 900.00 for 2 tickets in the 2nd row.  the stage was so high up that we could NOT see most of the show, unless he was right at our side of the stage.   we could not see him dancing and had to watch most of the show on the TV screens.  that is Not what i Paid for.  i was very upset and disappointed. the show itself was really good, what i could see of it .   the Cirque de soleil feel was a nice touch.    and he is a great performer.. i am going to ask for a refund for my tickets, i feel i was deceived and ripped off for the seats i paid for.

Chris Brown,"Where: 3Arena Dublin When 15.6.16 Time 7.30pm First Hoody Baby and supporting act. Then August Alsina. 30 min break and the great man himself appeared. The arena was electrified by this time, screaming singing dancing and that was just the crowd. Sang nearly all his popular hit records, dancers and backdrops were great. Anybody that hasn't seen Chris Brown perform before (My first concert) should go, even if you're not Team Breezy - my daughter who came with me isn't a fan but she enjoyed her night too. Great night, hot tired and sore feet but would definitely see him again (saving up already) ",
Chris Brown,"Okay, so this concert was officially one of my best, even though I've really not been to that many. Chris Brown was actually amazing and I could catch enough of the show from my seat but not from my phone though(the quality was bad). Besides that, it was amazing especially because even though he was reported to be sick about two days ago( had to cancel his Ohio concert for that), he still came to Chicago with his amazing dance steps, his beautiful voice and everything in him. It was amazing and worth every single penny. Cant wait to go for the next lol. ",
Chris Brown,"The concert was amazing I was already sooo excited to see my baby Chris but this experience was more than I asked for. There was a variety of artists like 2 chainz ot genesis bow  wow a bunch of old school artists who took me way back. It was so exciting to see all those people and seeing. Chris perform the way ik he can. His singing and dancing his ,over his voice I am in love completely. Yet another chris brown concert that didn't think could get any better but of cpurse I was proved wrong! ! ",
Chris Brown,"Honesty, this was my first Chris Brown concert ever. It wasn't what I was expecting. It was really loud and had an amazing vibe to it. Best concert I've been to so far and the guests were amazing as well. Had pretty good seats and either way you could feel everything, from lighting to the emotion that was put into each song. I would totally recommend going to see Chris Brown live!! ",
Chris Brown,hey chris! just want to thank you for being such an inspiration to me. it really helps me motivate myself when running around on gta beating women with baseball bats. ngl i wouldnt do that in real life but i heard some peoopel do go to those extreme measures. im sure ur a great guy really and its all the lousy media making melons up again eh. ur music is still the best tho ly man ,
Chris Brown,My dad bought me Chris Brown tickets for my birthday & I must say this was THE BEST GIFT EVER! I've been a Chris Brown fan since he first came out but I could never afford to go see him live. But FINALLY my wish came true! The concert was LIVEEEEEE ! Will most definitely be seeing Chris Brown again (: We had such a great time! Love you Chris! <3 ,
Chris Brown,Amazing!!!!!!!!! Loved every second he really gets into his music and makes you feel his vibe. I would go again if I could as the show was so fun. he interacted with the crowd on many occasions which made you feel more apart of his show and his dancing techniques are out of this world. He really wants you to have a good time ,
Chris Brown,"Chris brown was awesome!! Loved loved loved seeing him perform but very dissapointed that rich the kid didn't show up :/ really would like a partial refund because i bought these tickets for my boyfriend for his bday to see his favorite rapper, rich the kid. Who didnt even show. But again, chris brown was amazing!!! ",
Chris Brown,"It was so amazing!!! I've never experienced anything like it. I also had the pleasure to do the meet and greet with Chris Brown and it was breath taking. Thank you, thank you, thank you for an experience of a lifetime. God Bless You!!! You are truly talented and blessed. Love You La Sharie Sneed 5-12-73. Taurus ",
Chris Brown,The show was amazing.  He is a great performer n I loved his surprise guests like Young M. A. His dancers were awesome as well. Great great show.  Fabolous was extremely entertaining and kept the crowd jumping. Best concert by far.  Can't wait for the next one... Venue was great too.  Barclay's is a great site ,
Imagine Dragons,"The story of Imagine Dragons and their rise in popularity is an inspiring one. They're a band that put out a 4.5 star album (Night Visions) and toured religiously until it finally caught on. They played small clubs and were on the bottom of lineup posters just three years ago. Now they're one of the biggest bands around, headlining festivals and performing in arenas every night. I was lucky enough to see Imagine Dragons when they were just getting going. I saw them play The Metro in Chicago (one of my favorite venues) in what ended up being one of the best shows of 2013. I also love Night Visions. It would have been the best album of 2012, if not for Mumford and Sons Babel being released that same month. So when Imagine Dragons announced their summer tour, I was excited to see a Tampa stop included. I was not happy however, to see the show was at the 18,000 capacity Amalie Arena. This was quite the change from their first show in Tampa at the Ritz Theater with a capacity of 1,100. I also wasn't as excited as expected for the show because the tour is in support of the groups much anticipated second album - Smoke and Mirrors. The record was put out in February of this year, and I was extremely disappointed. In my opinion, the Las Vegas rockers abandoned their alternative roots and made a poppy record that would just get radio play. That record was on full display for their Friday night Tampa show. Imagine Dragons performed 12 songs from Smoke & Mirrors, essentially playing the album in full. Now I know this was the 'Smoke & Mirrors Tour,' but how about a nod to the album and the fans that got you to where you are today? Instead, the guys just gave minimal nods to Night Visions. They played the four most popular songs from it ('It's Time,' 'Radioactive,' 'Demons,' and 'On Top of the World'). They also played one acoustic verse each from 'Nothing Left to Say' and 'Bleeding Out.' It was nothing close to the attention that album deserves and fans were hoping for. I would have loved to have heard just one of the following: 'Hear Me,' 'Amsterdam,' 'Nothing Left to Say,' 'Round and Round,' or 'Selene.' Instead, I was listening to a poppy album in a half empty arena. That's right, sales were weak for this Friday night show in the music friendly community of Tampa. The floor was only at about half capacity. Maybe the $90 price point for a floor ticket was one reason, but it's never easy to get into the show when the band is playing at a venue much too large for their popularity. Another negative of the night was the formation and style that the band chose to lay out. Lead singer Dan Reynolds played 80% of the show from an extended part of the stage that ran down the middle of the floor. At times, it seemed like a solo show for him, rather than a full band experience. I couldn't even tell you any highlights from the other contributing members of Imagine Dragons. Lastly, one of my favorite things from the first three years of touring for ID, was their unique and constant use of rhythmic drums. They used to have drums of all sounds and sizes scattered across the stage. Each member would go to their drum station constantly throughout the set, and the beats and rhythms they came up with were addicting to watch. With the exception of 'Radioactive,' that fun portion of the show has completely disappeared from their live set. Overall, this show was a disappointment. There was a great band that put out a superb debut back in 2003 entitled 'Songs about Jane.' That band (Maroon 5) went on to release 4 more albums, with each being worse than the album before it. At the same time though, their radio play and recognition in the top 40 community has increased with each release. I think Imagine Dragons might be the next Maroon 5. CONCERT RATING: 2 Stars ",
Imagine Dragons,"I’ve been listening to the group since so long, and the first song I heard from them was Radioactive, which everyone knows I’m sure of it. The concert run an hour late, but nobody was complaining and they started with I don’t know why, which immediately put everybody in the mood. There was many generations mixed, and all the adults around me didn’t really knew imagine dragons, weren’t really sure if they were going to like it, and were really surprised to see they were just loving the concert. The group  was playing and singing at the perfection, all of them was contributing to the making of each songs, and there was such a good atmosphere it was really incredible. Dan Reynolds (the lead singer)  talked really often to the crowd during the show and also took a moment to raise awareness about LGBT youth, which was a really touching moment. Their energy, their complicity with each other, everything was perfect, and the last song, radioactive, there so well known hit, just ended the concert with a great energy. I loved it, probably one of the best concert I’ve ever been. Imagine dragons is not like many artists who just come on stage, say hi, sing ( either in playback, or wrong), don’t interact with the crowd, and get out of stage without a thank you. Imagine dragons talked to us so many times it was really pleasant, I’ve never seen a group or an artist take the time to say something relevant, they even went into the crowd during the show, to the back of the concert hall so people in the back could see them at least for 3 songs. It was perfect, and I sure will go to their next concert, because seeing Imagine dragons in live, is just magic and unforgettable. ",
Imagine Dragons,"Listening to Las Vegas native band Imagine Dragons through headphones is one great experience, but seeing them perform their upbeat guitar and drum tunes in person, paired with the resonating vocals of Dan Reynolds, truly makes for a life-changing event. The band has now performed all over the world due to their understandable success, and I saw them play at Lollapalooza in Brazil where they dressed in all black and gave the screaming crowd something they wouldn’t ever forget. The mellifluous band has a sort of chill, indie, rock and roll style, but they are far from an independent band – they embarked on a world tour after major success with their single “Radioactive” and have received lots of radio play for their cool guitar strums and cheerful yet relaxing music style. Seeing the band live really makes you want to get off your feet, and the lively lyrics will truly dare you to try and stand still in one place, as the music urges you to let go and give in to the feeling of the music flowing through your whole body as your hear it the amazing instrumentals and sounds. At Lollapalooza, the band didn’t require any props besides a simple few lights and their name in the background on a screen. All they need are their instruments, and Dan’s soulful voice. ",
Imagine Dragons,"This was the first concert that we took our two children to (ages 10 and 12) and they had a great time!  The venue (Shoreline Amphitheater) was fantastic and we enjoyed our view from the lawn. The opening bands were engaging and certainly warmed up the crowd!  When Imagine Dragons appeared, our kids were really excited and ready for a ""full concert experience""!  Imagine Dragons did not disappoint!  They played all the popular songs as well as some older ones.  They even changed stages halfway through the concert which was a great bonus!  The band definitely knew how to keep the crowd engaged from asking us to sing along to ""Yesterday"" and even releasing large balloons for the crowd to bat around throughout the second half of the concert. Their final few songs, which included Radioactive, were absolutely brilliant!  They had so much energy at the end it was infectious!  Their extended drumming section in Radioactive was awesome!  They ended with two songs instead of a typical walk off and then come back for an encore.  Their final song, Believer, was a rocking anthem that had us all walking away singing at the end of the concert.  Overall, it was a great first concert for my kids and a great reminder of why live music matters so much! ",
Imagine Dragons,"I haven't been on the Imagine Dragons bandwagon as long as some have. I picked them up after Night Visions came out and they quickly became an act I needed to see. Their catchy blend of pop and rock elements was always going to be a winner live. And it was. I saw them play to a sold-out Margaret Court Arena in Melbourne. Their support act were British India, a local band who had achieved reasonable levels of success on the national stage. They were solid and a good lead-in to the main act. They opened with Shots and built an amazing set list from there. They played all of their hits, debuted a couple of new songs they haven't done before and threw in a couple of covers (Forever Young and Beds Are Burning) to fill out their performance. Dan Reynolds is an amazing vocalist and his backing instrumentalists (Sermon, McKee and Platzman) complemented his eccentric and energetic performance style. The only letdown of the night was the atmosphere. I'm unsure if it was the venue's acoustics or the audience but it wasn't as loud or electric as the gigs I've been to before. Overall I'd give the show a 9/10 and that will only improve with another album or two of quality content. I'd definitely go see them again. ",
Imagine Dragons,"The concert was really great. Every members of the band had SO much energy that they shared with the public. Dan Reynolds made a speech on the LGBT youth at some point during the concert and that was great, he spoke with his heart and the public gave this love back. The light were blowing our minds and they were at their best during the whole concert. At some point, there only were instumentals and the singer (Dan Reynolds) lied down on the ground and started doing yoga, which was pretty funny. In the middle of the concert, they went on the second stage (smaller and in the middle of the room) so everyone could see them. They ended the concert with the first song we have (my sisters and I) discovered them with six years  ago. I truly encourage people to go to their concert because they are one of the most fantastic band of the 21th century. PS: if I can share an advise, if you really want to bring a goodie home, buy it BEFORE the concert. At the end, there are a lot of people and, I guess, less choice (we bought it before the concert so we had all the pleasure and time to choose what we wanted) ",
Imagine Dragons,"On October 1st I went to Imagine Dragons concert for the first time. It was a breathtaking performance. Dan’s beautiful and emotional speech is still in my mind, especially the part about things that don’t mean nothing and are given meaning like class, color, race. Dan’s voice is really powerful and very unique that makes you feel goosebumps. His personality is one of the best. He is an honest and a nice person which he expresses through his music, the way he talks and acts, the way he stays positive and inspires us to rise up, believe that the lost things will come back to us, be thankful to yesterdays, sometimes start over and do whatever it takes to make it up to our loved ones and become stronger, no matter how much pain we go through. Imagine Dragons does a great job in creating meaningful, inspirational and emotional music which is very rare in our day and age. My friends and I laughed, cried, danced, sang and screamed so much that we couldn’t talk after it. The feelings are unforgettable. It was an experience worth repeating a thousand times. Thank you Imagine Dragons. ",
Imagine Dragons,"really good live production, dan's voice is very beautiful live and wing's guitar solos were also impressive. the drummer did a very nice piece but unfortunately we didn't hear from the bassist. we sat in block 102 of the o2 arena which was on the left of the stage. we had a good view but there were a lot of couples around us who were not very enthusiastic about the concert which made the concert slightly sedate to enjoy. if you want to really get into the music I recommend standing but if you want to go with a friend or something to just listen and watch nicely then sit. also I wasn't really massively impressed with the track list. they didn't sing smoke and mirrors or bleeding out, which we were disappointed by. the encore song was ""the fall"" which wasn't the energetic fun song the audience was expecting. radioactive and demons were both excellent but I think they wanted to promote songs from the new album. still would recommend as you can watch nicely or really get into the music. ",
Imagine Dragons,"Well-imagined dragons: an excellent performance from an extremely enthusiastic and (at times almost too) humble band, clearly enjoying every minute of their time on stage. The support act, Sunset Sons, kicked things off excellently with some high-energy, high-tempo tracks to a very receptive crowd, setting the tone for the main event. forty minutes or so later, the Dragons burst on to the stage to a huge ovation, got straight into it and kept the pace up the whole way through, only really stopping from time to time to thank the fans, be a bit grateful and have a bit of a joke from time to time. I'm not sure if I had lower expectations than was fair of this band, who I've only seen once previously at Glastonbury '14 (which mainly involved them all being covered in mud), but for me they massively over-delivered on staging, performance and energy to provide a fantastic night, culminating in the inevitable, uh, golden shower of glittery leaves from above.  Excellent stuff. ",
Imagine Dragons,"Sound was pretty horrible, waaaay too loud, even with earplugs, which I almost never need to wear. Many awkward choices of covers with awkward musical production choices. Feels like as they only have about 4 hits, they just spent the entire first hour of the concert stalling for time, giving every band member a chance for a below-average, horribly sounding solo. The guitarist's overuse of harmonizer (+/-1 octave) only made his solo even more childish and simply sounded awful. Felt like he was trying to imitate Rage Against the Machine's creative guitar playing, although stealing techniques doesn't make it your own. I believe that this is what happens when a young band gain a lot of popularity in relatively short time, experience is noticeably lacking here. Visuals and lighting were good and with high quality though. ",
Imagine Dragons,"When we first knew that Imagine Dragons was coming to Spain we were very excited about it. The only problem was the distance (about 750 km to the nearest concert), but we didn't care because we thought it was a good experience. Once there, I was very nervious, but we got a very good place and a very good views. There was full of people as we expected. All the light and sound effects were amazing, and so was the group. They made us feel the music and we had such a good time. The band was also really ""sociable"" with the public. Some of the songs were missing, but the other ones were so good we didn't care. Of course they played the most famous ones, and we enjoyed them a lot. If anyone has the opportunity to go to an Imagine Dragons concert, I would recommend to go there immediately because, believe me, IT WAS AMAZING. ",
Imagine Dragons,"Why would you ever sit down at an Imagine Dragons concert? Every time a new song starts, a guitar, or drum solo starts they'll make you feel alive and free. Nothing can stop you, after seeing them perform.    Just their band name should be reason enough to check them out! If you like their songs on the radio you would never be disappointed by them live. In my opinion, they are way better live without all the editing. From their old hits to the new ones, ""tiptoe"" to ""Radioactive"" to ""Who we are"", you'll be singing them all night long.    This Las Vegas band that started with a little hope in a small garage, has become a phenomonon! They vary in styles which makes them even more appealing with a promise of never getting bored.    Imagine Dragons will make you start to imagine that anything's possible! ",
Imagine Dragons,"I think everyone going into an Imagine Dragons show is already equipped with high expectations. But damn, there guys brought the house down! This was my first time seeing them and it will definitely not be the last. The amount of energy these guys put into their sets is amazing. Dan showed is vocal range but changing a few arrangements of songs which just made me respect him more. Being in the crowd, Dan made you feel like you were apart of the show. He interacted with us throughout the whole show. Even name dropped a fan that was in the crowd that he recognized from social media. It's nice to see a band that appreciates what they have and the fans that love the music they put out. Leaving the show I wish the set would have lasted the whole night. ",
Imagine Dragons,"The Imagine Dragons concert in Stuttgart was one I'll never forget!  The opening band, Sunset Sons, was very good and entertaining, and after they left, it didn't take too long for them to set up for Imagine Dragons.  The band itself was incredible, sounding just like they did on their albums!  It had the emotion and energy that you just couldn't get from listening to one of their songs from an iPod, for example.  My favorite part of the concert was during Demons (or one of their other emotional songs), when the shower of paper hearts was poured onto the audience, adding to the spectacular atmosphere of the show!  Imagine Dragons definitely exceeded my expectations, and are by far the band I would most recommend seeing live. ",
Imagine Dragons,"I am a bit dissapointed... You see, I like these guys and I've seen them years ago, when they were just a little band, passionate about their music. Years later, they become not just insanely famous but also... cocky? Recent show I've been to felt childish, unprofessional. Their performance is no more about music in the first place, now they are too busy interacting with fans, talking some crap about world peace and making ""show."" Their large fanbase, now consisting mostly of 16 years olds, scream avidly all the time, it almost ruin the performance. But still, when they happen to play music from the first album, it is still great. And I hope the next time, they just could play ""Bleeding out"" instead of ""Song 2..."" ",
Imagine Dragons,it was the best concert I have ever been to!! I wasn't like a huge fan who knew all of their songs by heart or anything I just went because they have some good catchy songs. but then I got there and now they are my literally favorite band!! they were SO GOOD live!!! the lights and everything were so cool and the main singer seemed like he was such a genuinely nice person! the lighting was AWESOME I was in love with it it was literally so cool it was flashing and changing colors and there were lasers and smoke! it's so worth the money!! I would recommend getting floor seats but there aren't chairs on the floor so everyone on the floor is standing. so you either have to get there early or work your way to the front. ,
Imagine Dragons,"Imagine Dragons put on a fantastic show in San Diego.  So much great music in one night!  The band is high energy and powerful.  You can feel the gratitude coming off Dan Reynolds in waves, which is charming. He was really heart-felt. Reynolds made a run through the crowd during ""On Top of the World"".  The band covered Alphaville's ""Forever Young"" to great effect, and played the vast majority of the Smoke + Mirrors album, along with the greatest from their prior album. They took the stage at 9:30. I was grateful the show was both family-friendly, and not ear-splittingly loud. It's always a pleasure to find a truly solid live rock band.  Imagine Dragons fits the bill perfectly.  Highly recommend! ",
Imagine Dragons,"I have been to quite a few concerts, and Imagine Dragons is by far the best! Sometimes you go to concerts and the artist sounds nothing like the songs you listened to on the radio, but Imagine Dragons does not lie. They sounded exactly and I mean exactly like they sound on the radio, it was perfect! The performance was awesome! There was always something to look at, and I was fixated upon the stage lights and set pieces! It was mind blowing! Not to mention the songs themselves are always awesome! I always find I can connect with them in a personal way. I would completely and totally recommend that you go and see them, in fact I loved them so much that I would go see them again! Imagine Dragons is a must see! ",
Imagine Dragons,"The band and songs were amazing! The Venue was Perth Arena, the sound was awesome! I wanted to stand at my seat and enjoy the music and dance, but realised that the people around me were sat down so I was spoiling their view. The band could of made the audience all come together, by encouraging everyone. There was no encore? I think this was due to the fact that people started exiting too early, I would generally be clapping and asking for more!!! This didn’t happen, not sure why? Imagine Dragons were faultless in there performance, I loved that some songs were reworked, amazing! I thoroughly enjoyed the concert. GO IMAGINE DRAGONS!!!!! ",
Imagine Dragons,Great concert. Venue wasn't the best as it was standing and on a hill. I also had to move around a lot just to be able to see because of tall people standing infront of me. The opening act was very good and something I had never heard before. All the Imagine Dragon songs were great and the screens they had on stage were very cool. They ended the convert with Radioactive however for the encore they played 2 songs that were not that popular. It was still very good however I would suggest maybe ending on a big popular song. Overall it was a very good concert and the band were very into the music and were very grateful for what they have. ,
Taylor Swift,"When Taylor Swift first announced a tour, I was thrilled. For years I'd begged my boyfriend to take me to see Taylor, but we were always too busy. However, as I am from England and we were unable to find tickets for the UK, I knew I probably wouldn't be able to go. My boyfriend then purchased tickets and surprised me on my birthday, telling me we were going to Tampa to see Taylor. I was so excited. Walking into the stadium, the crowd were given complimentary bracelets that were used to increase the mood during the concert. The concert began with so much enthusiasm from Shawn Mendes, who definitely helped to get the crowd going, singing his earlier hit 'Stitches', as well as covers like 'thinking out loud'. He set the scene for a perfect night. The mood continued throughout Vance Joy, although many of the teenage girls giving Shawn support did not enjoy Vance as much. There was a lot of build up surrounding Taylor's entrance, but it was well put together, giving the crowd an insight into the evening. The bracelets mentioned earlier all lit up; the entire seating area was a sea of light. It looked absolutely enchanting. She entered to one of the most popular songs on her album ' Welcome To New York'. After finishing the song, the crowd went so mental, that we were all screaming and clapping for five minutes. She stood there, feeding off the positive energy, taking in the crowd. The amazing vocals and music continued throughout the entire night. I have seen many concerts in my time, but Taylor is by far one of the best- not only vocally, but performance wise as well. Her first special guest (although I cannot remember her name) was very good with the crowd, even though she was fairly new in the music world. I have to say, when Idina Menzel came out the whole crowd were partying, screaming to let it go at the top of our lungs and just having a good time. The only let down to entire evening was the sound system, as there was about a 10 second delay for, either side. This meant that we would hear everything twice, but also there would be two noises at once. It slightly killed the vibe, though you didn't notice it much once you were singing along. I would definitely recommend seeing Taylor and who knows? Maybe she'll surprise you. ",
Taylor Swift,"reputation Stadium tour Seattle, 9/10.  It all started when Charli XCX started singing. She was pretty good. But she probably shouted “SEATTLE!” 10 times. But the reason why I gave the whole thing a 9/10 was because Camila was not there. She had dehydration. And Taylor didn’t make up for it. Then it was TAY TAY! She came on stage with a “bad girl effect.” Singing Ready for it, I did something bad, and Gorgeous. Then it was a mashup of Style, Love Story, and You Belong With me. Then she sang look what you made me do. A HUMONGOUS SNAKE. Came out. It was so cool! Then with a gold jacket/background came End Game and King Of My Heart. Then she flew to the B-Stage while singing delicate. When she got to the B-Stage, we were SOOO close!!! She sang Shake it off with Charli. And then she got a guitar. And I freaked out. She sang Dancing with our hands tied and the mystery song. The mystery song ended up being “Holy Ground”. Then she went to the OTHER B-Stage and sang Dress and Blank Space. Then she flew on a snake cage to the main stage while singing bad blood. Then she sang SHOULDVE SAID NO. FROM 2006! I was freaking out. Then she came out and showed everyone her vocal range with Don’t Blame Me. Then she went to the piano and sang Long Live and New Years Day together. Then came purple jacketed GetaWay Car. Then there was a fountain and a mansion background and she sang Call It What You Want. Then came the last song. We are never ever getting back together/This is why we can’t have nice things. She got soaking wet in the fountain. And there were FIREWORKS!!!! It was truly amazing. Recommend it so much. ",
Taylor Swift,"Quality show. Taylor Swift puts on a quality show, she engages with her audience and seems to create a closeness that is hard to believe when you are one of 60,000 people in the audience. She gave everyone in the audience a bracelet, because we can see her but she wants to see us, so she gave everyone a bracelet that lights up. She can see all these pinpricks of light, and know it's a fan. I was very impressed. She introduced her band, back up dangers, and singers, she had a large main stage and then two mini stages. She went from the main stage to the little stages. She brought two special guests, including Selena Gomez. She performed all her singles, and those backup singers really cushioned her relatively thin voice, but still I was impressed.  It was a super fun show,  and she works with quality people who helped her put on a fabulous show. Definitely would recommend, because Taylor is a great performer. ",
Taylor Swift,"The Taylor Swift concert on July 19. Th was just life changing. It was the greatest performance I have ever seen by her and by anyone that I have gone to see. One thing I enjoyed about the concert is she connected with everyone and spoke to them, not just sang a couple songs and left. Also the way she captured the feel of every song and how they were all so different but connected somehow, through the show was just mind blowing. Many concerts I have been too did not have an inspiring touch to them, but Taylor really appreciates what everyone does for her and other singers who are just starting their careers. She is truly a very inspiring person, and going to her concert was a milestone in my life journey that I will never ever forget. Getting to meet Taylor Swift would completely make my life amazing and would also make a dream come true. Taylor you are amazing!!! ",
Taylor Swift,"I saw Taylor yesterday, Oct. 22, at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, TX. This was my fourth time seeing her live, and she was amazing as always. Taylor Swift concerts are like no other concert I've been to. She somehow can play to a crowd of 80,00+ people and make it feel like a super intimate moment. She played all of her hits and took time to sing some of her older, less popular songs (Fifteen, Sparks Fly, Holy Ground) for her truest fans. Seeing Sparks Fly live again was particularly special for me because it was the first song I ever heard her play live (on the SNWT), and I hadn't heard it live since. Her concerts are the biggest dance party you'll ever go to, the atmosphere is unbelievable. Her vocals and the band sound incredible live, also. Overall, I would 10/10 recommend going to see Taylor live and hope I get to see her again soon. ",
Taylor Swift,"I don't know where to start! I guess it all began at 9am, the day of the concert. This was the time I started lining up at the Eastern Entrance to the entertainment centre. About 11 hours later, my favourite (now turned) pop-star walked out on stage and performed an amazing show filled with songs from 4 different albums! I loved every minute of it.. The dancers were incredibly talented, the set was beautiful, the props, choreography, the costumes, lighting, everything was perfect! Taylor knows just how to engage an audience and put on an unforgettable experience for people aged 5-50!!! Not to mention, her supporting act.. Vance Joy, who was a fantastic start to the night! I would recommended her next tour to almost anyone who wants to have a blast! xx LOVE YOU TAYLOR & VANCE xx ",
Taylor Swift,"The show was absolutely amazing! Definitely worth every cent. I have been obsessed with Taylor ever since 2010, and this was only my 2nd show, and I was SO CLOSE! It was so admirable that the show went on, even though there was a THUNDER STORM. I loved the fact that she really appreciates us as much as we appreciate her, and I hope she knows that I will be there for her no matter what. There was a REALLY tall person, almost like a basketball player in front of me, which was a bit disappointing because I'm so short, but for some reason, he got replaced just before the show started, and I was so glad #sorrynotsorry I'm pretty sure the security did that. ANZ Stadium you did amazing, sweetie! Love you Taylor, and can't wait to see what you do next! <3 <3 Kisses, Alice ",
Taylor Swift,"That was the best concert I've ever want to  and I've been to a lot! I love  Taylor Swift I love all the clothes that she wears her attitude she always looks so pretty on stage.  When I was there and when she was entering the stage she gets the  crowd going crazy and  that's why everybody loves her!  I've been to a lot of concerts  and this one's the best by far. everybody there you're 15,000 people there but everybody got a bracelet that would flash to the beat of the music it was so cool because in slow songs it  would be blue and green and in  The faster songs it would be  Silver, gold, purple, and many more  it was so pretty!  She said that we were really good singers so then we sang a song  together! I love her so much and I hope she creates new album. ",
Taylor Swift,"This concert was AMAZING!!!! Okay, so even though we got rained on and were soaking wet and cold by the concert's half-way point- that aside... I had so so so much fun. Taylor is one of my idols and role models and it was so great to see her live. She is such a performer and not only was the music and atmosphere so contagiously happy, but the actual show and set design and technology that made it all happen was also amazing. From the lights, to the LED screens, to the blow up snakes, it was definitely the highlight of my week, and I would OF COURSE either go see her again or recommend it to my friends and family. Thank you Taylor and crew for an unforgettable night!!!!!!! ",
Taylor Swift,"An amazing experience. It was my first concert and the first time I seen a celebrity. I enjoyed it every single minute of it and the arena was full of excitement, joy and just about having a good time. Incredible performances by Camilla, Charlie XCX and Taylor Swift. The only bad takeway about this I couldn't see my fav artist properly I had to rely on the big screen to see what's going on. Next time I'll carefully choose better tickets as I want to see the artist properly not be too far away from them. I will always cherish this moment as it's the best thing that has happened to me in a long time. ",
Taylor Swift,"Absolutely biggest production Ive ever attended.Taylor was amazing to see and hear.Confirmed all my previous praises of her talents.She graciously shared her stage with some newer up and coming artists,which is rare these days.Everyone wants center stage always.To enjoy the HUGE audience of moms and daughters,sharing this grand moment together,was quite rich & genuine,for these turbulent times.At 67yrs old and music experienced from seeing so many acts from 60's on,and my first TS concert,well Im giving her 1st place,over everyone else.BRAVO TAYLOR for being who you are NOW<3 ",
Taylor Swift,"I went to the RED tour in London and it was simply amazing, probably one of the top 3 best concerts I've ever been to. Taylor's an amazing performer and her show is so entertaining, it's unbelievable. I was lucky to have gone to a concert with a special guest (The Script) and that made the concert even better because since it was a surprise the whole crowd was anxious to know who it was and the atmosphere was great. I recommend Taylor Swift live. She's incredible. Hoping I get to go to another one of her tours soon. ",
Taylor Swift,"She really gave away a show like I've never seen before. Her voice is so clear, I think she sounds live even better than she does on her albums. I went to her concert four years ago aswell, you can't compare those two shows because her music is so diferent then in her early days. But eventough her music changed and the fact that she is a grown up woman now, she is and always will be a great artist with a powerfull voice and great lyrics. If you're still in doubt if you need to go see her, you really should!! ",
Taylor Swift,"This concert what was my first concert ever! And it was amazing, not to brag, but if you didn't go to this amazing young women's 1989 concerts, then you're missing out on everything you can possibly think of! Like winning VIP and floor tickets to her concert, which didn't happen to me, my mom brought really good view seats, but super duper high seats! It was in the nose blood section, but I didn't care! I was having so much fun! Thanks Taylor so much for this amazing night if you're reading this! ",
Taylor Swift,"I have been to so many concerts in my lifetime. Considering I am 64 that has been a lot of concerts. Taylor Swift knows how to treat her fans right. This was the absolute best concert I have ever seen. I was in awe that a stadium tour could be so fantastic, entertaining, fun, and have such great sound. I took a friends 10 year old daughter to the concert. This was her first concert and she told me several times thank you for taking me to see Taylor she is awesome. Thank you Taylor. ",
Taylor Swift,"I've previously gone to Taylor Swift's RED tour and I thought she could never outdo herself. I thought wrong. In my opinion, the opening acts were amazing. Actually they were just so great I bought myself a Shawn Mendes shirt! When Taylor began singing, there were wristbands that lit up and made the stadium look absolutely beautiful, and she suprised the audience with Little Big Town out of nowhere! This concert was amazing and now One Direction has a lot to live up to! ",
Taylor Swift,"Camila did a great job opening; (we were starving and in line for food, so we missed Charlie someone) but she really did great! The entire Taylor show was fabulous. My daughter loved it. I’ve watched shows at many stadiums but since we were in the very top section of 320, I’m glad we were at Mercedes-Benz arena!!!! It didn’t feel like we were so far with the 360° screens above the center of the arena. It was my daughters first concert and we had an amazing time! ",
Taylor Swift,IShe was amazing and I’m shocked how I still have my voice from screaming so much. I loved the pop up snakes. I loved the snake and the glowing ball thing she rode in. Her voice was so good. I wish I could sing like her. I was so excited to go to the concert but now I’m sad it’s over. I loved how she played her old songs. I loved how Camila Cabello was there she was amazing too but not as amazing as Taylor Swift. I can’t wait to go to another concert. ,
Taylor Swift,"Best show I have ever seen. She doesn't just play for the people in the front she tries to get as close as she can to everyone. I haves seen 10+ artist in concert and none of them can ever compare to Taylor. She is quiet simply the most amazing performer, singer and songwriter this world has ever seen. I love her dancing too!! She is unique in every way and each concert is different from another, she doesn't try to be amazing, she just is amazing ",
Lady Gaga,"If Lady Gaga and her fans were a couple, they would be that couple: that loved-up pair of paramours in your life always making uncomfortable public displays of affection and loudly declaring their love – and, on occasion, screaming out from the upper reaches of an arena that ""oh my God, I love your bum!"". That couple who dress the same – sometimes in meat, mostly in sequins – and can't tear their googly eyes off each other, and who you just want to tell to ""get a room!""  When they do just that, as they did in Allphones Arena this Saturday night for the Sydney leg of Gaga's ArtRave tour, it's a big messy mutual lovefest. Gaga (Stefani Germanotta) doesn't just dedicate a song to her 'little monsters', or tell them they are ""one of the most authentic fanbases of the new millennium"", she pauses mid-song during Dope – ""I need you more than dope"" ­– to repeat lines that underline just how important they are to their queen. She schools them in her love.    The ArtRave set was suitably elaborate. And the costumes were as fabulous as you would hope for: Gaga changed on stage at one point into a multi-coloured fluoro Harajuku number; sang Paparazzi (gorgeously) as she was strangled by what appeared to be the spawn of a Dalmatian and a giant squid; and opened the night in a golden leotard with a blue orb protruding from her chest and golden wings spreading out from her back.  The tiny woman inside the outfits was a revelation: that huge voice soaring above the mess of noise in big numbers like Bad Romance and Alejandro. She was especially strong when settled at her white piano – on Dope, tears dropped from her face as she gave her arena full of fans pretty much everything, and a pared-back Born This Way gave the song the heft that its pro-LGBTQI message deserves.  Were moments like Do What U Want, when Gaga sat like a queen and the bum-complimenter behind us screamed out ""You are such a b---h!"" and we knew it was the nicest thing you could say at such a moment.  And then there was the moment of the night, when Gaga sorted through the toys and tat thrown at her feet and plucked out a letter. It was from a kid that she had encouraged to come out of the closet, despite his concern about how his parents might react. ""Through your music you've helped and set free many people,"" he wrote, now happily out, embraced by his parents, and thankful for Gaga's help.   The arena cameras honed in on him, and so did Gaga, telling her people to make sure he was backstage later. Then she firmly repeated the order – make sure he's there.  Great bum, great heart, very good show. ",
Lady Gaga,"You're not supposed to do this kind of show at Wrigley Field. Gaga did. Moving platforms, hydralic staging, dancers, fire throwers, explosives. Gagag delivered a set that began at 8:30pm until just before the alloted 11pm must-end, and filled it to the brim.  Lady Gaga held court over an audience that might not have gone to Wrigley before. We've been there for Tom Petty, the Dead, Elton John, Billy Joel, Paul MacCartney, James Taylor and Jackson Browne; Gaga just became THE biggest deal there. Gaga is iconic...and lets you damn well know it. She donned a Cubs jersey, acknowledge her role as the firsr female act to headline Wrigley and with a slew of costume changes, blew the joint apart. Rarely does any act own the whole audience; she has that live ""IT"" power; all the hits, some of ""Joanne"" and enough banter and personalizing of every number to make it worthy of recording like the Grateful Dead: it's honed to that stage, that show, that moment. It's the living difference between recorded and live art. Some costuming got twisted up and she kept singing, dancers unfeeling her, and when her contact mike was clearly dead, she kept playing her guitar intro as a dancer moved in with a mike without missing a beat: THAT, kids, is the sign of a pro. Stellar. Superb. A little schmaltzy with some very theatrical presentation, but if schmaltz is this good, love it to death. WE don't have a Judy Garland anymore; we don't have a young Streisand who could deliver the sounds, range and furious precision of a Gaga; just GO. Opening act of her DJ was one hour of loud, often too-profane ""meh."" One person near us said, ""there's othing more boring than watching a DJ."" True, dat. ",
Lady Gaga,"This is the second time I have been to see Lady Gaga she is such an inspirational Artist, I went to see her perform live in Birmingham at the NIA this year,(2014) Not only is her performance top quality but her showmanship is for me the best in the business. Lady Gaga put in a lot of effort into every aspect of her live performances, she designed the set and stage layout to maximise the ordinance participation. It was a even balance of her vast catalogue of work from Just dance right through to Artpop. The minute the curtain fell I felt a tingling sensation down my spine, This was something I had been looking forward to for some time for buying the ticket on line to the show its self. You maybe sitting there woundeering why I called her an inspirational artist? This is for two reasons the first is the artist bit Lady Gaga describes her self as an artist the inspirational bit is the fact that she has not only produced one of the most inspiring songs of all time Born this way but on the night of the show a young fan threw a note on stage, now Gaga could have simply given that note to someone and read it after the show, but she didn't, after reading part of the note to her self she realised how important she had been to helping the fan get through a difficult time for them and so not only did she read the note out loud but had the fan come on stage to help her sing one of her songs, yes, you guessed it Born this way and if one person can change, inspire and improve the life of others through her music then that someone is lady Gaga and that is why I get such a thrill seeing her live. ",
Lady Gaga,"It isn’t a lie when someone walks over to you and tells you that Gaga is amazing live, honestly it was such a good show! She provided us little monsters with a mix of older hits from previous albums (The Fame, The Fame Monster, Born This Way & Artpop) such as Applause, Alejandro, Bloody Mary (that was a real crowd pleaser!) and of course you can’t forget about Just Dance, Paparazzi, Poker Face and Bad Romance! As well as having a great variety on her setlist, she also ensured that the choreography was level with the setlist, giving us the most energetic and fun dance routines in which made us all want to dance too! P.S. her dance crew are just so talented, let’s just appreciate that for a few minutes! And to round this review up, her stage layout was made with little monsters in mind, Gaga made sure that she could get around the whole arena to be near all her fans, which shows just how loving she is towards us! (If you don’t know what the stage layout is like, here’s a short description: “The full layout consisted of a very dynamic and kinetic main stage, three flying bridge platforms which double as projection displays, two satellite stages and an LED integrated b-stage.” - TAIT (the builders of the stage/s) Although we expect big from Gaga, I don’t think anyone expected this BIG! She really blew us away, and all the time and effort that has gone into this your has truely been worth it, with the majority of her concerts selling out! (Cannot give specifics as her Tour has not finished yet). ",
Lady Gaga,"I attended Lady Gaga's concert in Birmingham on the 15th of October, I was a holder of a VIP Artpop Zone meet and greet ticket. The experience during the concert was amazing, she sang in front of us most of the time, unfortunately backstage I was expecting a little bit more, yes she was with us more than an hour talking, but we were a large group of 20 people and there were 2 particular people at ours who acted as if no one else had paid for it. They should have just gone around the room and asked everyone individually for a question. On several times I tried to draw the conversation back to our side of the room, as they seemed to have created the whole meet centred around a particular area.  Gaga is too polite, but I could tell she wanted someone else to speak because she kept looking at other people and saying 'has anyone else got any questions?. All in all, my experience was great but I was expecting more backstage, I had a VERY RUSHED picture taken and then BYE. Perhaps is not Gaga's fault but it is annoying that her team had rushed things. I love this woman with every fiber of my being, and I paid four months' rent for this. I have mixed feelings. Not having a minute to talk to Gaga in private for the amount of money we paid put me a little down as well. When the photo was sent to my e-mail I felt a little bit better though. I did it because it was my dream to meet her, but I've learned my lesson and will not spend the amount of money I did again. It's is for sure one of the my best experiences ever! ",
Lady Gaga,"I had one of the most amazing experiences going to a Lady Gaga show a while back. It was a bit like going to a Broadway show, a Circus, a dance club and a crazy Rave! The combination of all of these different occasions was something I had never felt at a concert before. Seeing 'Mother Monster' live was more of an experience than just a musical concert. I believe the Little Monsters (that's what she calls her fans) are such a unique crowd, with people from all walks of life, all ages, and all lifestyles. It was a people-watching extravaganza!! And then the show itself, my goodness, so many things happening, so many stage props, so many dancers, and oh how amazing the dancing was. Mesmerizing and picturesque. And then on top of all that throw in the insane costumes and the stage props, along with a light show that complimented every aspect. Truly a piece of art in a way. As I say, it just seems so much more than just a concert experience, it feels like a combination of so many things. The only time I have felt close to this, was way back at a Madonna concert when she was really in her prime and she was putting on performances of this level. It felt so good to see a performer attempting to entertain again, and entertain in a fantastic way. People may say what they want about Lady Gaga, and she does a lot of things to attract those thoughts, but putting all that aside, she is one hell of a performer and a show that I will gladly attend over and over! ",
Lady Gaga,"I am speechless.    As a die hard Gaga fan, I was completely excited for the concert- especially when I was queing. I qued for around 10 hours and it was honestly worth it.    The music was expectedly all live- Gaga performed a lot of ARTPOP songs such as Venus,Swine, and Mary Jane Holland as well as her well known hits. Her vocals were flawless- she even expressed her love by adding a Whitney Houston ""I will always love you"" ending to one of her songs. That alone was amazing. The show itself was insane- there was constant confetti and strobe lights pulsating the arena; let us not forget the amazing dancers fleeting the stage too. Gaga also took moments between songs to preach about equality, her feelings and general speeches of empowerment.   A noticable element of the show was when she picked up and read a young boy's letter of his struggled- she then got him and his boyfriend on stage to dedicate born this way to them. They sat either side of her on the piano, it was heartwarming. Personally, I think if people ignorant to Gaga's importance and talent were to attend artRAVE they woulf instantly be turned- it was that great. It was unforgettable and probably will never be topped. ",
Lady Gaga,"Well, to start, unless you just want to visit and hang out with other fans, I suggest you don't arrive early. You probably won't even make it through the line by 7:30 at the scheduled start time of show. But don't worry, the show won't start until 9:15pm (an hour and 45 minutes late) and there is no opening act. If you read the latest reports, this is what Gaga has been doing at her shows (it's all planned). Just when we were getting fed up waiting, Lady Gaga hit the stage. Her concert was amazing. It was colorful and exciting with the use of many high tech effects. The women has got talent! She brings with her a dozen energetic backup dancers. Her voice, her voice ......unbelievable! If you happen to have to have a seat rather far from the stage, no worry. She makes every seat in the house a good one as she drops small bridges from pods high in near the ceiling and connects the stage to designated raised circles on the floor all the way back to a smaller stage at the opposite end of the venue. She and her dancers move about with each song and manage to personally engage each fan in their seats with an up close entertainment opportunity. Worth the wait! ",
Lady Gaga,"from the time the huge clock started the 10 min countdown that would end with the playing of 'diamond heart' through to the 'million reasons' finale which saw Lady Gaga disappear into the floor leaving only her hat on the piano seat well over 2 hrs later the crowd was in in an uproar . I've witnessed literally hundreds of artists overthe years and this show is inside my top 10 all time . The vocals , the stage(s) the light show everything was top notch . She started strong with diamond heart, A-yo and poker face which really got the crowd up on their feet waving their hands in the air and the most touching moment would have to be when she explained exactly who joanne was and their unique connection and then she finished by whipping the crowd into a frenzy with bad romance, the cure and million reasons . I had made a10 hr drive to see her only to find out the show was cancelled earlier this yr, I decided to make the trrip again for the re-scheduled show and I'm so glad I did ! If Lady Gaga is playing anywhere near you , get tix !! You will not be disappointed ! ",
Lady Gaga,"Awesome show from start to finish. We saw her Enigma show in Las Vegas. Great set design and graphics. She performed her ass off as well as her backups. The Park Theater had great seat layout and perfect sound. My ears were not ringing afterwards. A little more then midway in show Lady Gaga slows it down a bit to do “Million Reasons” and opened up a letter thrown on stage to read. It was from a younger woman from Chile who has been a strong fan from the start and feels her life saved by listening to and admiring Lady Gaga. She worked extra for over a year to afford getting to Vegas to see her and waited to get in front row. She was invited on stage to sit with Lady Gaga while performing the song and was told she’d be reimbursed for her costs getting there. Totally awesome and tested up many in the crowd. Lady Gaga also tested up crowd again at the end and about how much she survives off her fans and the love all around and then sang her newer song “Shallow”. If you can go, I highly recommend!! She stated her residency is extended to 2 years so far! ",
Lady Gaga,"Lady GaGa put on a whole production with her artRAVE. It was everything that I expected it to be from all of the articles and stuff I read online. She had a really good setlist, and the look of it was perfect. There were so many spotlights and different colors throughout the show as well as many outfit changes. As usual, she had a ton of dancers and a big large production ahead of her. The energy level of the crowd was unreal and there were a lot of very interesting people there. She played almost every song off of her latest album ARTPOP. Merch is super over-priced for sure. I don't think that it should be that expensive. I really enjoyed the show and it was very memorable. Lady GaGa has so many different things that she does in her live show that it would be very hard to forget. A very large and energetic crowd at Chicago's United Center. One of the best arena shows and productions that I have ever been too. ",
Lady Gaga,"I love Lady Gaga. She has performed some of my favorite music artist acts on award shows and my favorite Superbowl half time show I've ever seen. I expected this concert to be spectacular but it wasn't,  neither were her two other concerts. It was a very cool stage! My favorite performance was bad romance, it had cool Pyro effects and with classic Gaga creativity  instead of the pretentious boring cowgirl persona with terribly designed outfits. I'm not a huge fan of Katy Perry but her concert was better than Gaga's. I give Gaga's concert 7 and Perry's an 8. Gaga needs to put more effort into her concerts using more of her creativity. I can't quite put my finger on what makes her concerts so mediocre but it could be my high expectations due to what I've seen on TV. ",
Lady Gaga,"I saw Lady Gaga at the Tacoma Dome on 8/6/17 during her Joanne World Tour. Oh my god this concert was amazing. I was already a Gaga fan going in so I knew that she is talented. But wow. She played two songs, “Edge of Glory” and “Joanne”, acoustically, and I was absolutely blown away by her pure talent as a singer. And when you combine that with the fun and theatricality of songs like “Alejandro” and “Bad Romance”, it becomes an absolutely enthralling show. She played a good mix of older hits and songs from Joanne, and turned “Come to Mama” into a nice tribute to the LGBT community. Overall it was an incredible show that I won’t be forgetting any time soon. ",
Lady Gaga,"I saw Lady Gaga for the first time last night in Salt Lake City.  It was AMAZING!  I have never seen any musician be so engaging, authentic and filled with love.  To say that Lady Gaga is talented is an understatement of massive proportions. The music was wonderful and inspirational, the costumes were fabulous, the dancers and band a tight group. It's been a while since I've been so impacted by a musician and their performance.  After her first song, she specifically thanked the audience for spending the money and time to be with her. I've never seen anyone do that at the beginning of their show. This woman is now one of my most admired people of all time. Love, love, love her. ",
Lady Gaga,"Wow. I've never seen Lady Gaga live and I expected it to be a great show, but she exceeded all of my expectations. It was raining and she had broken stage machinery so it was a stripped down version of the show. When she walked out onto the catwalk in the pouring rain she said, ""I've been waiting all night to be in the rain."" Even soaked while playing the piano she killed. The highlight of the show was her sitting down at the piano to play Edge of Glory. Just her, the piano and the rain. It had me all misty. It was crowd pleasing show with all her best hits and a lot of the new album. Go see her. It's an unforgettable show. ",
Lady Gaga,I really loved the Lady Gaga show.  It was allot different from the one that I had saw two month ago in Philadelphia which made it even better!  Lady Gaga seems to alway reimagine herself which keeps her shows fresh and alive.  My only disappointment was I landed myself in a very bad spot to view the concert and even though the LED screens helped compensate for that it wasn't the same as actually seeing her.  Either way Lady Gaga was the first and only entertainier that I had seen twice in a row in such a short period of time and she was worth every penny! ,
Lady Gaga,"In a way this was the culmination of all that Gaga has learned about how to perform live. It was a 100% full-on performance with just the right levels of all the tracery that is needed live - lighting, moving stages, dancers etc., etc. It was the perfect vehicle for her consummately perfected vocals with a sound mix of her greatest hits and the best tracks from her country-style album, Joanne. As zany as ever where it needed to be and cut-back and simple where appropriate. At 2 hours 20 minutes it is good value and a memorable experience. ",
Lady Gaga,"Hands down one of the most enjoyable concerts we've experienced!!! On our feet for two and a half hours. She's a dynamic performance artist and brilliantly talented. Her message of love and acceptance and her witty humor are contagious. We LOVE Lady Gaga and her passion to share her music and spirit with the world. We are 65 years old and married 40 years, have 3 sons and daughters in laws and 2 grandchildren. We've been huge fans of Gaga from the very beginning. We are proud of her journey and will go to more of her concerts. Thank you! ",
Lady Gaga,"One word: Amazing. It was easy to enjoy a show with so many great hits, but she goes above and beyond. She really gives the fans their money's worth! I was happy to see that she wasn't over-doing it with extreme dancing since she has recently become open about her fibromyalgia. Her dancers were getting it, and it was so much fun to watch. I forget that Lady Gaga can really hit those notes because she's such an amazing performer / writer / artist but she reminded us of that gift. Would I go again?... Hell yeah! ",
Lady Gaga,Absolutely phenomenal! First woman to headline Wrigley Field in Chicago! Won't be the last. Amazing live performer. Lady Gaga set list Friday at Wrigley Field: 1. Diamond Heart 2. A-Yo 3.

David Guetta,"The man behind some of the biggest anthems of the past few years, David Guetta is probably the best of his kind. Previously not a house music fan, my mind was changed after a friend bought me a ticket to see David Guetta at Alexandra Palace in 2012. Reluctantly I went along, little did I know that after a 3 hour set, I would be converted forever! Opening with ‘Titanium’ and following up with by blasting out hits like ‘When Love Takes Over’, ‘Sweat’ and ‘Wild Ones’, the crowd were sent into a frenzy as the energy in the room just kept on rising. Clearly displaying why he is so respected by fellow DJs and artists alike, it may sound cheesy, but it really seemed like this is what David Guetta was born to do, as his permanent smile revealed just how much he was enjoying every minute. Huge production, made up of fireworks and confetti cannons, made the show even better. It has always astounded me how DJs are able to sell out arenas, even stadiums in some parts of the world. The secret is in the infectiousness of their beats, something the David Guetta has perfected, making him one of the best. He has definitely converted me into a lifelong house music fan. ",
David Guetta,"One of the biggest names in dance music has collaborated with a huge string of stars of the past decade to create some momentous world-wide hits. Now the French DJ has collated these into one massive live show where he drops in some of his personal favourite dance/pop records from a variety of eras. You cannot fault David's charisma when playing to a live crowd, he visibly enjoys what he does as the more energy the crowd give the more animated Guetta becomes within his DJ box. As he drops the likes of 'Shot Me Down' and 'Titanium' he hypes the crowd further by dancing along with the masses. His sets often feature numerous tracks from a variety of genres, recently he has been known to spin hits from Iggy Azeala, Linkin Park, Bastille, Hozier and Oasis. It is fair to say there is something for almost everyone during Guetta's set and you assured to dance along to at least one piece of music during sets that often last for 30 songs or more. Usually finishing with 'Sexy Bitch' or 'Dangerous', the smile on David's face mimics the audience as he feels assured he has played a great show. ",
David Guetta,"I have fun of my life everything was perfect David Guetta was wonderful as always but also before him the others DJs were very good too and Songkick is so good for, because they keep noticing us about it very often and we brought the tickets there and very safe and in two to three days we received our tickets. No better app out there better than Songkick so I wanna thank you so much from the bottom of my heart ",
David Guetta,"It was just amazing, perfect show, with amazing lights effects and a perfect set ! The first part was really cool too. Everything in the Halle Tony Garnier was cool, well organized and easy. No wait to enter, and no wait too to exit ! 20/20 ",
David Guetta,"Unbelievable. This is my 6th Guetta’s concert and he never ceases to amaze me. He has such a great energy and always interact with the crowd. If you never got the chance to see him live, you MUST go. It was the best show ever. ",
David Guetta,I’ve been to over 20+ shows this year and David Guetta was the worst. He started off great and absolutely downhilled and plateaued. Many people started leaving and the venue also oversold tickets. Waaaaaay too crowded. ,
David Guetta,It was the most amazing concert in my entire life and I really really love it and David Guetta was something unbelievable and whatever I say i can't say enough Thank you wango tango very much for this wonderful concert ,
David Guetta,"Loved the show and music, but got the feeling that David was not ""living in the moment"" It was a dream come true to see David, and i loved it. But if he were to get ant better he should take in more guest artists ",
David Guetta,"The world biggest discothèque: great mix of music, amazing scenography, a human and humble DJ, and 14k people dancing and shouting loud! Over 2 hours of a wonderful show! And 2 first part with sam feldt and ?! ",
David Guetta,That's really the best of the best! DG and https://www.kingbillycasino.com/en-AU make me:) Every music lover should feel David Guetta shoow! The best producer in modern music industry. Wanna him in au ,
David Guetta,Er hat in1 1/2 Stunden nur 4 Songs von sich gespielt und sonst nur so Techno. War echt enttäuschend. ,
David Guetta,It was good but way too short (1h25) especially for the ticket price. But I guess this is what should be expected when you have a large media presence. ,
Justin Timberlake,"The lights dim and a robotic female voice counts down, inching you closer to the moment you’ve been waiting for…ten…nine…eight… The spotlight casts his silhouette 30 feet high onto the wall of Madison Square Garden, an image of regality, Justin Timberlake clasps the cufflinks on his white Tom Ford suit…seven, six, five… His shadow brings light into the hearts of the city. This is it, New York. And you’re ready…four, three, two, one… Justin Timberlake’s falsetto floods you with dopamine as he slowly rings out the first 30 seconds of his love anthem “Pusher Love Girl”. The band pulls on the harp strings. His voice pulls on your heart strings. Notes tip tap down the spines of 18,000 adoring fans. Pheromones and sound waves fill Madison Square Garden, seeping into the bones of the city that never sleeps. There is nothing quite like the lovestoned story Justin Timberlake croons to a crowd of thousands lucky enough to partake in his live music journey. The 20/20 Experience World Tour blessed New York City on that freezing February night, but JT and his backup  singers and dancers, The Tennessee Kids, kept the women warm and wanting more over the course of the 2+ hour show in which sexy is definitely brought back. It's a night of non-stop getting in of the groove. As if the honeycomb stage and laser light shows were not visually stimulating enough, JT delivers on a once-in-a-lifetime personal experience with an animatronic catwalk stage that came to life stories above the crowd, traversing the stadium. Fans across the entire arena get the chance to be no more than 5 feet from Justin, take selfies with the President of Pop, and if they’re lucky enough to sit in the VIP Pit in the back, can reach out for a handshake and hang out with The Tennessee Kids themselves. Good luck finding the drive to wash your hand after that… ",
Justin Timberlake,"Justin Timberlake the 20/20 experience! Or pure awesomeness experience.  Everybody knows Justin Timberlake is brillant, he's talented, he is an incredible showman and he knows how to razzle dazzle a crowd! From horny ladies to the non-fan hubbies (who were just there to make sure their lady does not end up throwing herself at JT), everybody was more than pleased by this incredible 2 hours of magic.    Justin just can't do wrong. The music is great, the band is incredible, the energy of the 6 dancers, backing vocalists, lights, stage, INCREDIBLE setlist, the DJ prior the show; everything is perfect and everybody is under his spell after the show. The guys want to be him, the girls want him. He's entertaining, he's fun, he's talented. He really raised the bar with this tour.    The 20/20 experience show is a great blend of all Justin's records from the first to the last. Your favourite song is on the setlist for sure + amazing covers of Michael Jackson and Elvis. He plays piano, guitar, dances, sings, acts, we wonder what he can't do... The cherry on top is that gigantic see through catwalk which moved from the stage to the back of the arena where Justin stayed for 3 songs, allowing the entire arena to be upclose and personal with him. Go ""Experience"" Justin, it will be worth every penny spent ""This I promise you""! ",
Justin Timberlake,"I truly hesitated on spending such a large amount on 2 concert tickets.....SO WORTH IT! Justin Timberlake and the Tennessee Kids put on not only a musical performance of top artistic quality but the stage and light show was also a strong, almost extra member of the tour. The Tennessee Kids kept the beat pumping and the energy swinging. Their ability to quickly move through pop pieces was impressive. The pure delight and energy that they were feeding the audience was also addictive.   Justin was top notch not only as a singer but also a dancer. I am always amazed that someone can sing and dance so hard for such a long period of time. I really enjoyed that in between songs we got to experience his personality and sense of humor.  I was most impressed when he kept it simple with either just him and a piano or him and an acoustic guitar... it reminds you why he is so widely appreciated, because Justin is just plain talented.   If you are debating the ticket price, don't... bite the bullet and enjoy the 20/20 Experience. I am so glad I went as it was an opportunity to cross another performer off the bucket list. ",
Justin Timberlake,"All I can say is WOW! I have to admit I was not a fan of JT until I heard Suit and Tie and now I am hooked! I also was not expecting such a well put together show. From the second he came out singing Pusher Girl to the end he KILLED IT!!!' He was sharp as was his band and dancers. He also sang an Alicia Keys song, Frank Sinatra, Kool and the Gang and BBD. He also threw in Elvis just to even it out. That impressed me. When the stage raised up and moved across the arena I almost passed out. Him and his dancers were still jammin as the stage moved and came back again!!! The boy is DOPE! He came out at 9:00 pm and didn't leave the stage until 11:30 with only one 10 minute break. I am writing this 7 months after and it's like I saw him last night. He is coming back to the Barclays in December and yes I will be there! Oh and his set list covered songs from each album. When Suit and Tie started everybody lost it. Again a good crowd adds to the enjoyment of a concert!   I am bringing sexy back!!! ",
Justin Timberlake,"We've been patiently waiting for Justin Timberlake come to Ottawa since 2000 when he came with NSYNC. He so didn't disappoint! I saw him on his Future Sex/Love Sound tour in Toronto and this show was just as epic. He had us on our feet all night long and it was so worth the money. Heck... I'd probably pay more next time if I could swing it!   He even had a short 10 minute intermission which I've never experienced before but it was kind of nice. He was on stage for a solid hour before the short break, and when he came back, he was on stage for about another hour and 15 minutes of non-stop dancing and singing. The stage was pretty awesome too. And from what I can gather about the VIP area... so worth the money. That's according to my friend who bought tickets to sit there anyway. If there were an infinite amount of stars to give JT's 20/20 experience tour I so would. Do yourself a favour and GO SEE HIM!! ",
Justin Timberlake,"Great performers are the people who can make a stadium venue feel like an intimate show. Someone who connects with each person in the audience. Justin Timberlake is a charismatic, talented performer. His personal interaction with the crowd separates him from an artist to an entertainer. He even went out of his way to sing ""happy birthday"" to a lady in the crowd!  I had waited seven long years to see this man in action and he didn't disappoint! He has such an amazing energy, you could literally feel the electricity in the arena. At times he was just standing on stage grinning while the whole stadium was erupting with screams and applause.   After the intermission part of the stage moves to the other side of the stadium, getting the crowd in the stands that little bit closer to the man himself.   JT. What a night!!! ",

Justin Timberlake,"I have been a Justin Timberlake fan since ""Tearin' Up My Heart"". Every time I hear him sing, I'm as giddy as a 14 year old girl. (I'm 30). His on stage presence makes you want to be his friend because you feel like he is genuinely a nice person. His interaction with the fans makes me feel like he a real person, not superficial or self-involved like a lot of these stars. Days before the concert, I had all 4 solo CD's on repeat. It's been 5 days since I saw him and I still have it on repeat. His voice was authentic and flawless and I could have died right at that moment and been happy. ",
Justin Timberlake,"JT and the Tennessee Kids, were fantastic. I have seen Madonna in her prime, U2, and Dave Matthews with Carlos Santana. Each one I thought was the best concert I'll ever see, Justin blew them away. The light show, the dancing, and interaction with the crowd was unlike any show I've experienced. His cover of Bel Biv Devoes ""Poison"" was like taking a time machine back to 1990. I recommend that you experience this show.    I believe, again that this was the best concert I'll ever see. ",
Justin Timberlake,"Very interactive with the audience. Not a ton of props so he kept his tour simple. His dancers didn’t have elaborate outfits, but went with his tour “Man of the Woods” style. Seems like he likes to have different openers at different shows. He had a freestyler and also a pop/alternative artist open for him- a Canadian artist named Francesco Yates. Justin Timberlake performs well in concert and authentic to his recorded music, and he brings a lot of dancing! ",
Justin Timberlake,All I can say is that it should be illegal for one individual to be that talented!    I giggled squeeled and screemed like a little school girl!   Best show I've EVER been to and I probably go to at least 5 gigs a month.   Well worth the money; consider it an investment in a memory that will stay with you forever. ,
Justin Timberlake,"I flew for this very concert from Tbilisi, Georgia. The concert was absolutley fantastic. O2 is s great venue. The sound and video effects was amazing. Si great that Justin came in the middle of the scene that we can see him. The band, backvocals and the dancers were adding more amazement and chill to the concert. ",
Justin Timberlake,"Excellent show...!!! From his opening number, “Filthy”....to his closing song “Can’t stop the feeling”....it was non stop entertainment....the light show was fantastic, his dancing on point....and he interacted with the audience really well.... I would definitely see him live again....! ",
Justin Timberlake,The show was amazing! He never disappoints! He is talented all the way round. It was definitely worth the 7 years wait! I just hope I don't have to wait that long again! I love that man! He's amazing and just great! I truly enjoyed myself! Thank you JT! I love you! ,
Justin Timberlake,Great performance. He hit new songs and almost all of the big ones from the past. He's is a great musician and tremendous dancer. My only qualm with the show was 30 minutes of downtime between his undercard and his performance where nothing was happening. ,
Justin Timberlake,Justin was great! He danced the entire time and the lightshow was choreographed perfectly. Key Bank Center's sound quality was a bit disappointing.. bass sounded off for a few of the songs and it was a shame becuase it didn't give the band justice. ,
Justin Timberlake,"Great show, the best ever. Had the opportunity to set in the VIP section and we had a ball. JT puts on one of the most dynamic shows ever, I just love him. the crowd was going crazy. I loved every moment of it. Love you JT ",
Justin Timberlake,"He postponed the first show & cancelled the second due to laryngitis and inclement weather. So we never got to see him preform. Maybe someday we will see his show, but I'm bummed we didn't get to see this one. ",
Justin Timberlake,"I bought tickets for my sister as a surpise. It was for both of our birthdays. Epic performance. My sister and I had the best time.! We had no doubt you'd put on a good show! Jacqlyn P. Fort Wayne, In. ",
Wiz Khalifa,"I originally didn't come to see Wiz Khalifa, and didn't mind the idea of missing part of his set and showing up for the entirety of the Fall Out Boy part. But by the end of the night, I've got to say that Wiz is a better showman, better live performer, and more energetic than FOB was, even with their more dedicated fan base. Opening with a video of his smoking a joint with two naked women, I knew the concert was going to be something to remember, and while he was onstage it never quieted down. Even from the lawn section (not ideal seats, but super cheap) I was able to see and hear everything, due to massive screens, great sound, and visual effects of epic proportions. Every time he rapped about weed, green smoke and marijuana leafs would envelop the stage and appear on the screen behind him, while sometimes showing clips of his music videos along with the performance. Unlike FOB, he never left the stage until he was done, performing some of his best, like Black and Yellow, You and You're Friends, A$$ Drop, Promises, So High, Stayin out all night, and a particularly great performances of Work Hard Play Hard and Young Wild & Free. Even when I didn't know the songs he played, like roll up and Taylor Gang, the energy was enough to keep me going and I was never bored. Throwing massive inflatable joints into the crowd was one of his best moments, and It'll be hard to forget his performance. Worth seeing. ",
Wiz Khalifa,"After his somewhat questionable ventures in and out of prison for drug possession, some people have become dubious of Khalifa’s spot in the limelight, but there’s absolutely no denying the irritatingly catchy tune of ‘blackandyellowblackandyellow’. Once it gets stuck in your head, there’s no escape. Wiz initially built his fan base through cult followings gathered through his release of mixtapes, but this became an unnecessary feat after the boom of ‘Black and Yellow’. Although the cult following that he initially obtained means that now his gigs are somewhat ‘pot heavy’, if you’re willing to overlook this and embrace the lyrics about rolling joints ‘bigger than King Kong’s fingers’, you’re in for a pretty awesome show. His charisma translates through to performance, engaging with both his band, and audience, often welcoming out his producers and team mates to take a bow, a gesture of inclusion and gratitude. Khalifa’s clever hooks entice the audience and pushes rap into the mainstream music genre, blurring the lines of traditional stereotypes, and encouraging a broadening of the audiences music taste. ",
Wiz Khalifa,"Despite only releasing his debut album in 2006, Wiz Khalifa's discography now stands at six full-lengths and a mammoth 37 singles. It's no surprise that his live set lists often exceed 20 songs and yet from the reaction of the crowd, this still isn't enough. Wiz has built a reputation as one of the most exciting newcomers to hip hop in the recent years and it is easy to see why as he flies through the likes of 'Hope' and 'Sleaze'. His biggest international hit 'Black & Yellow' gets a big cheer from the audience when it is played in the middle of the set without prior warning. The more technical rap and freestyle tracks invoke larger reaction as Wiz confidently runs through verses without a single slip and the audience cheer him along. US hit single 'We Dem Boyz' evokes huge reaction from the crowd and Khalifa capitalises on the enthusiasm by following with 'Young, Wild & Free', his collaboration with Snoop Dogg. Despite only being released in 2011, this track has quickly become an anthem as the audience yell back the chorus and sway their arms as one unit. ",
Wiz Khalifa,"That shit was wack trust, Wiz performed only like 3 or 4 songs and that was at the very very end everyone was dead tried of standing for hours. There were a bunch of guys acting like they were gonna fight. Until finally there was one right behind me P.S. that guy got knocked the fuck out he was just laying there like a dead fish for about a cool minute and once he got up he had blood dripping from his corner right eye, i got some blood on me, that's what i get for helping him up. Shit he might have deserved it, i don't know. Anyway Wiz had a bunch of his artist preforming they were all pretty wack expect Tuki Carter. Either way the show was disappointing but i guess that's what you get when tickets are sold that cheap. ",
Wiz Khalifa,"Wiz Khalifa was honestly one of the best shows I have ever been to. The atmosphere was awesome, and so was his overall message to the audience. ""Be positive and accepting of others, because in this life all anyone wants is to be accepted"". The set list and other performing artist we're amazing. Wiz played some of his well-known songs in the beginning, such as ""Black and Yellow"" and ""Roll Up"" while also mixing in tracks from his new album like ""We Dem Boys"". Ty Dolla Sign, Jeezy, Iamsu and Sage the Gemini made the show so worth while. The entire audience was on their feet for most of, if not the entire show. My friends and I really enjoyed ourselves, and we would all definitely attend more of Wiz Khalifa's tour! ",

Wiz Khalifa,"originally had lawn seats, but due to a massive downpour we were upgraded to amazing seats, for a better view. Had to say I was surprised at how much Wiz had bulked up since last year. I loved all the songs, and he hit all the favourites. I could have listened for another hour, as he has so many great songs. Wiz seemed a little more mellow this year with his stage moves, compared with other years. Will definitely come back for next years' concert!!! Maybe with weed being legal next year he can have some kk sold as well as tshirts :) ",
Wiz Khalifa,"Spent $350 on Platinum seats. General admission standing area got better views and some even went on stage. They were $85 tickets. I should've had a better experience. I bought these tickets in March as soon as they went on sale as a surprise for my girlfriend who's a huge fan. Also French Montana just got on stage and yelled ""Heeeeeehhhhaaa"" on top of every one of his pre-recorded songs. The violinist's mic feed was cut and the same with the drummer. Would not recommend 1/5 stars. ",
Wiz Khalifa,"I lost my friends and as I went to the front of the lawn to find them wiz cam out there on a platform and it was cool as fuck except for the fact that it turned into a mosh pit and I got thrown to the ground 3 times and my shoes got ripped off my feet. I spent the next two hours walking around blossom without shoes, but it's cool ",
Wiz Khalifa,"Wiz is one of the most exciting rap artists in the world. He been producing my favorite hip hop song ever. everthing from ""Black and Yellow"" to ""See You Again."" Also, last time I went to his concert I bought my apparel from www.albumapparel.com. They are a small startup, check them out if you are thinking about buying Album Ts. ",
Wiz Khalifa,"The show was not even a show. We waited for hours for him to get the mic. Then he did 2 songs at 1:50am, and was done. Didn't leave, but just didn't feel the need to perform anymore songs. I get that it's a club, and not a concert, but I've been to club performances before, and this was by far the most disappointing. ",
Wiz Khalifa,"I had such an amazing time! I once saw Wiz with Mac Miller years ago and loved Wiz, so I've been waiting to be able to see him back in Pittsburgh! I'm so glad I went! Everyone there was good, but Wiz and Snoop killed it! Absolutely amazing! I can't say it enough, but I loved it! ",
Wiz Khalifa,I went to his concert on 7/29/18 it was a great experience never been to a concert like that before I had a wounderful time and I would love to see him again maybe up close I was in the the lawn and I was able to see him took some awesome videos best concert ever ,
Wiz Khalifa,The show was Great!!!! The sound was perfect the atmosphere was awesome. The music was Fabulous....Snoop brought me back to my good ol' Cali days!!!! Overall we had a really good time!!!! Thanks Wiz and Snoop for an Awesome Show! I will see you again. ,
Wiz Khalifa,"It was not a concert so you should definitely not label it as one if its gonna be the artist at a table. It was cool to see him in person but I was waiting for a performance the whole night, so I was pretty disappointed when it never happened ",
Wiz Khalifa,Good performance and interacted with crowd but everyone was waiting for 3 hours for a 15 minute performance? Too short for amount of money paid especially when he was behind the stage for half an hour so he could have come on earlier. ,
Wiz Khalifa,"Once again Wiz puts on a great performance. An not just Wiz, it was the supporting cast who out did their self. That shit was Lit! Rae S, O. T., them boys shut it down. One of the greatest performances I have seen in a while. ",
Wiz Khalifa,"By far the best concert I've been too. When Kevin Gates came out I really started to enjoy myself. Snoop and Wiz are so go hand and hand. The music really pumped you up and I knew almost every song, so that makes it better. ",
Wiz Khalifa,"By far the BEST show I have been to at Usana Wiz's performance was outstanding! To say the least, never seen the crowd more in the air then when Wiz was performing, definitely buying vip the next time he is here! ",
Wiz Khalifa,Not that awesome. Left sober. ,
The Killers,"If you've never seen The Killers live, you should probably kick yourself. As a long-time fan, but someone who hadn't seen them in concert until their latest studio effort, I still find myself kicking myself for never having gone to see them. The energy when they're on stage is infectious. They feed off each other and also the crowd, and the crowd feeds off of them - always seeming to leave both sides hungry for more. I guess that's what a great live band does. For the show at Borgata's new Festival Park venue, the first surprise was the return of the K as part of the keyboard stand. This iconic throwback to the Day and Age era kinda had me hoping this wouldn't be more or less the same Battle Born tour set list that they've been doing for nearly three years. At 20 songs long, it was a full set, with a few surprises, but was largely unchanged from the last time I saw them. Of course, this is a band that has four albums under their belts, and because they don't want to disappoint more casual fans (as in non-Victims), they don't want to leave out any of their hits. Opening with Mr. Brightside, lights still on, the smile on Brandon Flowers' face was apparent that he has missed his onstage brothers. The smile didn't fade as they drove on into Spaceman, and after introducing the band as well as Ted ""Named after the great Ted Williams"" Sablay and Jake ""The Snake"" Blanton, they carried on to The Way It Was. Smile Like You Mean It led into Bling, followed by Human. A return to their first album was introduced by a chills-inducing heavy bass opening as Somebody Told Me reminded everyone why they became as big as they are. A cover of CCR's Bad Moon Rising led into a surprise of their 2012 album Battle Born as they played the life out of The Rising Tide - a nice surprise. After Shot at the Night, For Reasons Unknown, and From Here On Out, things slowed down for Dustland Fairytale and another surprise, Be Still. Read My Mind and Runaways led into a bittersweet All These Things I've Done. Why bittersweet? When All These Things comes on, fans know it's the last of their main set. The last surprise of the night came with the first of their encores as they rolled into Uncle Jonny. We know that The Killers (almost) always include their very first album opener: Jenny Was a Friend of Mine - They don't come all the way from Las Vegas and not play Jenny. When You Were Young was the show's closer. With the news report over, here's the editorial portion of the review. This band never disappoints - even in the rare instance that they're off their game, they're still on their game. For the show in Atlantic City at Borgata Festival Park they were undoubtedly on their game. Seeing them on stage together, it was as though it was where they wanted to be. The show in AC, before a crowd of 4500, was a warmup for the 70,000 strong crowd at Firefly. Of the 4500 people leaving Festival Park, I don't think one of them was disappointed. I even caught one of the guys working security singing along to a few of their older hits. While I would have loved to have seen some of the lesser-played songs instead of the set they played, it's only because I've seen them do these songs so often, and had never seen them perform prior to 2012 (huge mistake on my part). The Killers want people to leave their shows with a sense of satisfaction, so, playing their most popular songs is a given. Still, I would just love to hear Sam's Town at least one more time, and quite honestly, I wish they'd drop the cover song they do (for the last 6 shows I've seen, they have always done Bad Moon Rising). With an arsenal of 4 full albums, they certainly have enough original material to play a full set without tossing in a cover version. (At least it's not Shadowplay!) Nothing would ever be able to stop me from making the effort to see this band perform. The 22 hour round-trip to the Jersey Shore was well worth it; they never disappoint. Ever. If I could, I'd be at a Killers show every night for the rest of my life. Yes, a Killers show is one of my personal Sam's Towns - if you don't know what that means, do yourself a favor, and while waiting for their next tour, check out their live DVD - Live From the Royal Albert Hall. You'll see why Victims, myself included, will travel all kinds of distances to see these guys perform. ",
The Killers,"The Killers played the first night of Lollapalooza last year, and they made it a night I'll never forget. From the stage lighting to visual effects on the screens, The Killers put on a show that captivated the thousands of people that came out to watch them.    The band erupted with ""Mr. Brightside,"" which sent the audience into a state of excitement. Everyone started dancing/jumping/singing to the music. There was a lot of jostling around, and I kept getting pushed forward by people from behind trying to get closer to the stage. I remember while I was belting out the lyrics to ""Human,"" someone grabbed my arm and started dancing with me. The audience was so friendly, and looking around, many people had huge smiles on their faces that shone against the colorful stage lights.    The Killers have been around for quite some time, and anyone can see that they are clearly at ease playing in front of thousands of people. The lead singer, Brandon Flowers, sang even better live compared to the audio recordings. He didn't even take a water break or anything; he just kept going and going, and throughout the entire performance, his energy stayed sky high (his collared shirt was unbuttoned and drenched with sweat by the end if the night). He introduced the rest of the band and was very interactive with the crowd, reaching out to touch outstretched hands.    The concert had a fun, friendly vibe to it, and I was surrounded by people who were all so happy to be there. That concert was the first time I experienced a night show outdoors, let alone in the heart of downtown Chicago. Looking up around me, the skyscrapers we're lit up and the stage lights bounced off of them. It was such a beautiful sight. Jamming out to awesome music under the city lights was the perfect way to end my first night at Lolla. ",
The Killers,"This was, so far, the best concert for The Killers that I've ever seen (& I've seen them 3 times already). The acoustics for the Staples Center wasn't the absolute best, but it didn't matter when the whole stadium was singing at the top of their lungs along with the band. First of all, since this was the Wonderful Wonderful Tour, I thought the band would play mostly songs from the new album, but to my surprise, they performed a great mix of songs from their entire discography. What surprised me the most was that The Killers played a ton more songs from their Hot Fuss album than they ever had before. They even dug deep to perform such notable songs like ""Andy, You're A Star"" & ""Smile Like You Mean It"". A beautifully sweet touch was when the band performed a new, sort of spur-of-the-moment, song about Los Angeles...a song they had written on the road just before their L.A. leg of the tour. One of the major highlights of the entire concert was when the band had invited a young teenage fan up onto the stage to play the drums on the song ""For Reasons Unknown"". Apparently this has become an ongoing tradition of the band, to invite fans up on the stage to perform with them. This was such a touching, yet totally bad-ass moment, & I hope The Killers keep on doing this at every concert tour from now on. By the end of the concert, my friends & I had lost our voices from singing & screaming so loudly, but it was one thousand percent worth it. The Killers proved with their electrifying & humorous stage presence, along with their amazing voices & talent, that they will forever hold the spot of being my all-time favorite band. ",
The Killers,"The killers in vancouver, how can i even but this into words that people will comprehend? For me, the killers are my favorite band and Brandon Flowers is a HUGE inspiration in my life. His style of writing impacts me in a huge way. Also, for me, the killers music helped me a lot with personal problems that had hit me pretty hard in my life. I listen to their music when i'm happy, sad, healthy or sick, and for me, seeing this concert was in a way, life saving. And being such a huge fan, i had high hopes for this show and they did not at all disapoint. I went to this show with one of my closest friends, who is also a huge killers fan. The show began with 'Wonderful Wonderful' (as you may have assumed) and soon after they jumped right into 'The Man'. The setlist was incredible. I honestly couldn't say that i was disappointed with any of the songs they chose to play. I wish they would have done 'Bones' or 'Under the Gun' but i had low hopes when it came to those two. The stage presents was incredible. I couldn't take my eyes off of Brandon. He is just one of those people who can really own a stage and engage a crowd. And coming from an aspiring guitarist, i would normally be watching the guitarist almost out of habit; but with the exception of guitar solos, I was watching Brandon. This is a show I would heavily recommend going to. For me, it was the greatest experience of my life. The only negative of the show is figuring out how you're going to top it. -J.W. Radlinsky-Shworan ",
The Killers,"I hadn't listened to the Killers in several years and was invited by a friend to go see them in concert. I'd forgotten how good they were! Their show was full of energy and the evening was nothing short of spectacular. It seemed like every inch of the stage was covered with lights, and the show was filled with special effects some including fireworks. A Killers concert is like a massive stadium type of show, full of power and special effects. The band played all their hit songs and even included some cover songs that really were done well. One of the really good covers they played was the Smiths “There is a Light that Never goes out”. The crowd was very energized and the show started out at full force when they opened with one of their better know songs “When You were Young”. The band finished with several encores including some of their first hits, I guess the show ended up lasting about 90-95 minutes. The venue was large but it was pretty full. The crowd did get a little out of control at some points during the show, but the stadium was large enough that they had good security and you could just move away from people who were getting carried away. The band is getting older but they sounded great. It is good to see them back in rock and roll form. ",
The Killers,"The Killers delivered a high energy polished show. Brandon was in great voice, drummer was fantastic. A great rock show for sure. The venue, however... just atrocious. Place Bell in Laval is a new arena for 10K attendance, but it has massive logistical & design failures. 1) crowds waited 25-60 minutes to enter the building ... outside in -35C! ... due to an inadequate entry plan. Thousands of concertgoers were invited to show up between 7-8 pm, to be greeted by 4 open doors and 6 security stations. 2) parking congestion nightmares & traffic woes before and after the show 3) electricity on stage went out 3 times during the show 4) other concert-goers reported no drinking fountains, toilet paper, limited mobility access... SUMMARY: Go See the Killers, not at Place Bell in Laval. ",
The Killers,"The Killers, as always, were amazing beyond mere words. I've seen them in concert before, but somehow this particular concert at Outside Lands 2014 was especially memorable.    From singing Credence Clearwater Revival & Otis Redding covers, to performing all their greatest hits (and then some). I was completely pumped up from beginning to end. As per their usual Las Vegas-ian flare, the light show almost stole the spotlight from Brandon Flowers & his famous lightning bolt keyboard, but no one can captivate & amp up an audience like Mr B Flowers. I think I might have been one of the loudest singers in my section of the crowd. Singing along to all the ""Direct Hits"" is always the best part of the concert! ",
The Killers,"It was my first time seeing The Killers after a number of years waiting to see them play live. I have never had an experience quite like this one. They are a truly special band to see play live, the energy of the crowd is infectious, and you are left wanting more. Brandon Flowers, man, I don't know how he does it. Plays show after show after show and still sounds incredible. The additions to the band were awesome and Ronnie is a beast (in the best way.) My favorite thing about their show was actually the stage design. It was so beautiful and colorful and set the tone perfectly for each song. You will have a BLAST at their show, whether you're a hardcore fan or not. Can't wait to see them again! :-) ",
The Killers,I actually saw the show at Barclays on Tuesday the 8th. Let me start by saying I see a lot of concerts every year and was only familiar with the better known of The Killers songs. Having said that - they were EXCELLENT! Flowers is a magnificent front man with a set of pipes to carry stadiums. The band is flawless and so rock and roll. I will judge a band by how much they can hook me with a song I’ve never heard before . From the opening with Wonderful Wonderful and The Man thru The Calling start to the encore I was dazzled. I downloaded everything and I’m now a confirmed fan. I will see them again ASAP. One of the best live I have seen -ever. And I’m no spring chicken. ,
The Killers,"It was amazing!!! From the moment they went on stage to the very last second it was just so much positive energy coming from the band. The crowd was bad, but that isn’t The Killers’ fault! They did the absolute most and it paid off. Brandon hit those high notes despite his flu, Ronnie was legendary on the drums, Ted was amazing, the choir was amazing, et cetera et cetera. It’s a shame (especially for the people that DID know all their songs) that the crowd bothered them so much that they didn’t play Mr. Brightside, but again, the band isn’t to blame. These Las Vegas legends know how to give a great performance! ",
The Killers,"A killer show (heh)! No, but seriously, Brandon Flowers know how to put on a show. Despite the sound in Ericsson Globe being less than great for concerts, The Killers manages to blow my mind. A nice mix of mega-hits and just great songs that made even the sitting part of the crowd stand up and dance. The “first” ending with “All these things that I’ve done” almost made me cry, and the final finale with the two giants, “When you were young” and “Mr. Brightside”, had the whole crowd scream out the lyrics in pure concert-mania. In conclusion, if you want a good time, go see The Killers. ",
The Killers,"Fantastic night - Brandon's singing was impeccable and a good mix of new songs (from Wonderful Wonderful) and their old hits. The encore of 'Mr Brightside' created a wonderful (haha) sense of commraderie in the stadium. The lighting/set was great, not to mention Brandon's sparkly suits! The opening act of ALex Cameron had me dancing and singing along - he's a new favourite artist for me. By the end of the party I had lost my voice but it was worth it. Only dissapointment was that Dave and Mark were no where to be seen! Ronnie defo made up for them by killing it on the drums. ",
The Killers,"The show was overall ok but they never played Mr. Brightside! They just walked out after the encore even though it was on the set list as the last song! It was disrespectful to the fans and really just left a bitter taste in everyone's mouth. And it was surprising since they were playing a lot of their old songs throughout the night, I only counted like 3 songs off the new album. Just a bizarre experience at the end with the entire crowd shaking their heads and looking around to see if it was a joke. Just play Mr. Brightside and make everyone happy next time guys! ",
The Killers,"I love The Killers! And I loved their concert!! The band played amazingly, and Brandon is an outstanding performer! And his voice came through, booming in the arena. The effects, the lights, and all these small details they set up on the stage were terrific! It was a magical night! I can't wait to see them live again!!!! Next time, standing because the atmosphere down there looked amazing. I'm really looking forward to seeing them again!! I strongly recommend you all going to see them live! The Killers are amazing and gave us a show we'll never forget! ",
The Killers,"The show was incredible! It was really the Brandon Flowers show as the rest of the band kind of stayed in their places and play their instruments however it was worth every second. As Brandon always does he gets the audience worked up and stands up there like a conductor and got the audience involved and I loved every minute of it. I was able to dance the whole time and he played almost all of the favorites. The only two songs that were not played that I would have like to hear were maybe Bones and definitely Joyride! Loved, loved, loved, the show! ",
The Killers,"It had been a long time coming.  My previous attempt to witness The Killers live resulted in a cancelled show and my money back.  One move across the planet and 4 years later, I got my second chance... And it was worth the wait. The guys were in fine form: great pace, fun crowd interactions, the light show was fantastic and Mr. Flowers sounded impeccable.  The arena somehow felt relatively intimate as spectators were able to sing their hearts out to very well known and loved songs that haven't aged a day.    Sign me up for the next one! ",
The Killers,The killers concert was so amazing last night! I still can't get over how amazed I was. There backdrops were do amazing. All of the band members did so good! I loved ever song that they played (I wish they would have played Miss Atomic Bomb) and Brandon Flowers was SO amazing! I absolutely loved him last night. If they come back here I will definitely be there. So please let them know to come back. And if you have never been to a concert before then would be an AMAZING first concert. I love you The killers and have an amazing life ,
The Killers,ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!! BRANDON AND THE BOYS MADE IT FEEL LIKE WE WE'RE ALL IN LAS VEGAS! I'VE WAITED SINCE 'HOT FUSS'TO SEE THEM PLAY LIVE. BRANDON COULDN'T STOP SMILING ALL NIGHT AND WAS SO HANDSOME AND CHARASMATIC. THE WHOLE NIGHT ERUPTED WITH EXCITEMENT AND WE NEVER STOPPED SINGING!!! I CAN'T RECOMMEND HIGHLY ENOUGH TO SEEING THE KILLERS LIVE THEY ARE INCREDIBLE!!! I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE BRANDON &THE BOYS AGAIN. THEY TRULY ROCKED BRISBANE!!! THANK YOU BRANDON FLOWERS AND THE BOYS FOR SUCH AN AMAZING NIGHT!!! ,
The Killers,"Well, I gotta say it was a terrific concert. I did not expect what I experienced because I never went to any of their concerts before. I really liked the environment that these people created the scene. I really appreciated the fact they established what is true with symbolism: man is man and women are women. I also enjoy the songs. I did not expect at all they signing ""The River is Wild"" which is one of my favourite songs of them. Great concert, people behaved properly, the arena was good so overall it was all great. ",
The Killers,"The band was awesome, the production, staging, sound, etc were nothing but incredible. Sadly, it was the first time ever the band did not play Mr. Brightside in a gig, which is understandable due the lack of response of the crowd. Even though the venue was perfectly adequate and full, the people just did not live up to the energy of the concert and it was clear the band was unhappy with the feedback. I would go to another The Killers' gig without  thinking it twice, but maybe in a venue other than Amsterdam. ",
Usher,"I remember seeing Usher in concert for the first time back in 2002. He was hot back then and he still is today. Although his main gig lately has been being a judge on The Voice, don't let that make you think he still doesn't have it. Take it from me, Usher's live performances are just as amazing as they were years ago. His good-looking body, charm, and talent pulls you in and you'll be hypnotized for the whole concert. When he sings off of his old albums such as ""Confessions"" or ""You Remind Me"", you can't help but sing along. It's like time-travelling back to my college  days, watching his videos on MTV or buying his CD's (wow, remember CD players?!). He really gives his performances his all, and it's quite obvious because before the first half of the concert is over, he is already sweating. When he dances like Michael Jackson, you see how talented he really is, he's not jut an incredible voice. His stage setup isn't super distracting either. The most he has is huge video displays, stares, fire, and smoke. Although it's obvious everyone loves his old songs, when he starts with his latest ones such as ""Moving Mountains"", the crowd melts. At moments like that, it's as if he's singing to you personally; I'd bet there isn't a girl at that concert who's not wishing he was theirs! He has a magical way of bringing you on a rollercoaster ride, singing break-up songs and then switching to songs where you can't help but dance – it's so much fun. Usher's live concerts are just simply awesome. ",
Usher,Usher's show was by far the best show that I've ever seen.  It was so good that I literally lost my voice from screaming too much.  Everything was perfect from his performance to the the lighting!  He sang all of his greatest hits in which Nice N Slow is my favorite!  I knew that he was going to put on a good show but it was far more better than I could have ever imagined!!!!  It was my very first time seeing him in concert and it won't be the last.  He definitely did not disappoint and my favorite part of the show was the finale when he took his shirt off.  I just totally lost it and am paying the price for it today because now I lost my voice!!!!  Lol!!!!  But it's all good because I love Usher and I will go see him anytime!!!! ??? ,
Usher,"Usher can dance his butt off! This was my first time seeing him perform live although it wasn't a full concert, Usher only performed one song but it was more of a teaser for what is to come. He just announced a tour and when he comes to NY I will be there. I can already tell it will be an electrifying show! Can't wait to hear all my favs... ",
Usher,"This Phenomenal Man puts on thee Best performance. When you see him live even if you weren't a fan you become a fan by the opening of the concert. He gives 1000 percent to the fans when he performes whether it's in state or international. I will Always support this Euphoric Artist, Always worth my time and money. ",
Usher,"AMAZING!!! This is probably the best concert I've been to. Usher is the king, great job! Couldn't stop dancing. Lights and all the effects were awesome! Sound was a bit to loud sometimes though, but doesn't matter because the whole concert was on point. Thanks to one of the best musicians and great person! ",
Usher,"This is a show that I will forever remember!! The talent, the skill, the moves on that man!! I could go on about his voice. There is nothing comparable to hearing his voice live. It sent chills! This song kick app helped me reserve coveted floor seats with its notifications. One for the books. ",
Usher,i have been a fan since call me a mack ?lol so that tells you we are around the same age lol i have been wanting to see you live and i did!!!! So worth the 6 hr drive EVERY MINUTE!!!!!!! You were awesome really want you to visit San Antonio we LOVE you here man!!!!!your number 1 ,
Usher,"IT WAS AMAZING! definitely worth the money. the vibe was great and the night was one to remember. I've never seen such extravagant productions from the lighting, live band and amazing vocals. Let's not forget his moves. I'm already geared up to see him again, its a must x ",
Usher,The entire lineup for the show was great. I was kinda disappointed in Usher however. He did more dancing than singing. He had a good set list though. After waiting for over 30 minutes for his appearance though it was just not as good as it could have been. ,
Usher,He was born in Chattanooga Tennessee I went to school with him damn how money changes where u come from guess h3 doesn't remember singing to me at his last day in Chattanooga and he promised to come back hehehehe still one of my favorite singers ,
Usher,"It was an amazing show! The sound could Be better, the music was sometimes so loud the singing was hardly to hear, but i really loved the show! Check my compilation on YouTube: http://youtu.be/6wf24IMLokE ",

Ariana Grande,"My sister really loves Ariana Grande and one day I had some extra money so I surprised her with tickets to a live show. She is a popular singer and my sister really loves her but I was pretty skeptical,I really wanted to do something nice for my sister though so I went anyways. When she introduced herself at the start of the concert she had a really heartwarming voice and just seemed like such a nice person. The crowd got all quiet when she started singing and there was an atmosphere of excitement and anticipation in the air. She started singing and her voice was hauntingly beautiful,all my skepticism evaporated in a wave and I found myself hanging on her every word, especially during ""Almost is Never Enough"" and ""Honeymoon Avenue"". The lyrics of her music were incredibly well crafted and her voice was perfect for them. I felt like I was experiencing something unique and was very glad to have come. Ariana looked amazing in her dress and just seemed really classy overall,it made it really easy to respect her as a singer. The crowd just remained quiet throughout and everyone was watching with respectful interest. My sister had a fantastic time and overall I had a much better time than I thought I would too and was glad I went. ",
Ariana Grande,"I went to Ariana Grande's concert in San Jose at the SAP Center, and it was one of the best concerts I've been to. I went with my mom, aunt, and cousin, and we all had a great time! Ariana threw a great concert! Her two opening artists were both great and built up the excitement in the crowd. Cashmere Cat might not be for all, but Rixton had a very great set and interacted with the audience. When Ariana came on stage, I could feel the excitement throughout the whole arena and Ariana's voice was phenomenal! I could tell that she was not lip-syncing or using auto tune and she was very energetic throughout the show. She had many costume changes as well as changing the stage, and she even came in on a cloud and chandelier. Her closing song was Problem and I could tell that she totally enjoyed singing for all her fans. Overall, I would most definitely go to another one of her concerts! Her presence was powerful and her singing was spectacular, and it was all around a great show! Honestly, this show is more for younger girls/boys and teens but I saw a lot of moms and dads enjoying themselves at this concert. The screaming is loud and merchandise is a bit pricey, but it is totally worth it. Thanks for the great show Ari! ",
Ariana Grande,"Hello I am so disappointed . I tried to send this message lastnight.  But never seem to be able to contact the ticket company. I  paid a lot of money for these tickets , paid airplane tickets & hotel to go to this concert with my young daughter for a birthday present. I have found it extremely difficult to actually get my tickets in hand , have made many  phone calls to ticket master, chasing around to agents in ibiza  to try get them printed ana ALL with no luck. And they were not sent to me. We have arrived here to pick up the tickets at office at Palau San Jordi and have been told that my tickets cannot be printed .   I have paid €330 for these , plus all the other expenses ana cannot enter ! It's ridiculous.  You had more than half  a year to get my tickets to me and yet failed. I would like a refund totally and some compensation as have made a wasted trip to Barcelona from ibiza for this! Please can someone call me on 0034 657729330 to sort out From a VERY DISSAPOINTED  customer Lisa ruding Bryan iPhone 0034 657 729 330 ",
Ariana Grande,"Ariana Grande is the latest american teen star to make it big globally. With a vocal likened to the iconic Mariah Carey and a string of international hit singles from her 2014 album 'My Everything', she is one of the most in demand stars of the moment. Her live performance is polished and concise, perhaps due to the theatre background she came from before her breakthrough. Often performing elaborate dance routines during her hits such as 'Be My Baby' she still hits every note intended and wows fans all at once. The petite star is relatively humble despite her seemingly overnight transformation into a megastar. She is confident yet still acknowledges fans throughout and performs sections of songs on the front row. The place erupts in cheers for her solo hit 'Problem' and although there is no guest appearance from Iggy Azalea, she tears through this pop gem. Encore track 'Bang Bang' is slightly anti-climatic as the majority of the vocal is actually Jessie J yet Ariana puts her own sugary sweet spin on the track to the delight of the crowd. ",
Ariana Grande,"Yesterday I went to the Ariana Grande concert in Hamburg. I really enjoyed the show, she sang so good and hit some high notes! The background effects were also very cool and matching to the songs. If you’re into her music i’d definitely recommend going, because it’s an awesome performance to watch. You should keep in mind that the screen is kind of small, so if you want to have the best experience, get your seats in the front or buy tickets for the standing area. All in all, I absolutely recommend going, even if you’re not the biggest fan of her, because the light effects (there even was a moon hanging down) are breathtaking, but if you’re more into acoustic concerts, you should overthink going. Anyways, I loved the concert and totally enjoyed it! ",
Ariana Grande,"I was at the show you did in São Paulo and I loved the show, but since nothing is perfect, the organization left something to be desired. Outside, there was no queue and the organizers said, ""Do not queue up! Get together and walk according to the schedule movement!"" And so it was each one pushing the other all day, because of that we could not go to the bathroom, eat or even sit. We could not do anything. When we got in, they searched us and when we got inside, we saw people with accessories that were forbidden in the regulation, like: camouflaged print clothes or big bags. The stage was very far away and the screen was of poor quality. The organization of the ""Dangerous Woman Tour"" could have been better. Thanks for listening! ",
Ariana Grande,"The show was incredible. She is the most talented person with the voice like an angel. One of my dream came true. She sang live with backtracks but an live band. The dance moves were flawless and the outfits stunning. Of course her make up too:). I'll go to another concert if she's coming to germany. The songs were so cool, but I think that she could took more of the TY,N album or dangerous women. So and one more thing.. the prebands were a little bit boring bc idk social house was fine and there are so cool but Ella May was a bit boring. She's a good singer but the show was.... But idc. I saw my idol live!!! ",
Ariana Grande,"Best concert I have ever been to. Ariana is my absolute inspiration for everything and she is so strong and brave regardless of everything she has been through. She made everyone at the concert smile and have a blast. She has the voice of an angel and made sure to not let anyone down. if I were Ariana's mum, I would be more than beyond proud of all her achievements. I had the most magical time and I hope to meet Ariana one day. Ps: I LOVE YOU SO MUCH ARIANA AND THANK YOU FOR BEING THE MOST AMAZING ROLE MODEL FOR ALL GIRLS OUT THERE AND FOR ME. I HAD THE BEST NIGHT OF MY LIFE!!! Love you dangerous woman xxx ",
Ariana Grande,"Absolutely flawless! The concert started with two support acts who I had never heard of and was expecting to be boring. This was quite the opposite! Although I didn't know the lyrics to any of Victoria Monet's or B.I.A's songs, they created a lively and hyped atmosphere for the 40 minutes they were each performing. Then a 10 minute countdown appeared on the screen of Ariana to come on. When it reached 0, the arena went black and 10 seconds later came alive with lights, screaming and Ariana with her row of back up dancers. A truly unmissable event. I'll be sure to go to her next tour!!! ",
Ariana Grande,"I was fortunate enough to see Ariana Grande perform in Toronto Ontario on March 05 2017. The costume changes , the props etc were on par with any big name pop artist. Ariana took to the stage after little mix already had the crowd up on their feet and loud but the atmosphere went to a whole different level when miss Grande took the stage . For the app 90 min she was on stage the atmosphere was insane . I have seen well over 100 musical acts of various genres and I can say without a doubt that Ariana Grande has the most powerful voice I have witnessed live . ",
Ariana Grande,"I was at the concert in Denmark with my Best friend and my mom, at my birthday my mom suprised me with 3 tickets to Ariana´s concert i was so exited and happy. When we came to the concert and she came on the start off ""Be Alright"" played 3 times and the 3rd time she came on and all began to scream its was just the best day ever in my entire life... I screamed the lyrics out off my heart its was all i hope for and every time she said "" sing Denmark"" All began to scream and i just screamed the lyrics out of my heart. Its was just the best time of my life. ",
Ariana Grande,"Very disappointed- I go to a lot of concerts and this concert was one of the worse ones I have attended. First off, the show was pushed back 30 mins, which was not a big deal because we were notified a week before the event. In reality, the show didn’t start even start at the pushed back time it started at 830. The opening act was only on the stage for about 20 minutes and did not even preform the song together. We waited another hour before Ariana started her show. Prolly would not have been so bad if the internet was blocked. So glad it is over. ",
Ariana Grande,"Me and my sister wanted to see her in Amsterdam, but the tickets were sold out in 10 minutes. Then I saw that she was also in Milan Italy.(Yes sounds a bit crazy but my dad live in Italy and we both had that day off so it was a good long weekend to spend in Italy.) So my dad bought the tickets and decided to surprise my sister as a christmas gift, and yes she was happy. The concert was amazing and the view was perfect, me and my sister really enjoyed. Also the support act Rixton did also a great job!!! ",
Ariana Grande,"Ariana, dancers, effects... everything was amazing. She’s truly talented and sweet. The arena organization was not as perfect as the performance because we bought inside the arena a bottle of water and told us that we can bring it to the stage area, however a very angry security guy threw the bottle to the bin when we wanted to enter the stage area, so we couldn’t drink water during the whole performance. However, it was still the the most amazing, memorable performance in my life<3 ",
Ariana Grande,The show was awesome. Little Mix ladies were high energy and beautiful. Strong voices and their backup dancers were superb. Ariana was amazing!  The lights and video visuals were unique and exciting. Her voice is unparalleled. Her wardrobe changes were pretty quick so we didn't get annoyed waiting for her. She sang a variety of hits and lesser known songs that were just as beautiful. I didn't see many empty seats in the house. She puts on a great show that is well worth the money! ,
Ariana Grande,"Rixton was performing the first part, unfortunately they started probably 15 minutes before the concert was announced. However, they were great and kept the show going with good energy and humour. Ariana arrived like a queen. NO PLAYBACK that is such a relief compared to other performers. She is so cute and moves very well, along with her dancers. (Negative point : The scenography was a bit kitch and not that great.) Go see the honeymoon tour :) ",
Ariana Grande,"I'm a huge fan of Ariana... So no matter what I say itll be to support her. The only bad thing was how short it was... I wish it were longer. Meet and Greet was amazing and I had a great time, even though I waited for a hour and a half. She's even better live and in between outfit changes there wasn't ever a dull moment, she had performances to keep the audience going. Her set list was amazing, the fact that she put Pink Champagne in it was amazing. ",
Radiohead,"(Concert Radiohead in HMH 20-5-2016) Na 8 jaar (Westerpark) was het weer eens zo ver, het live aanschouwen van  Radiohead in Nederland, nu in de HMH. Het optreden van 2012 (Ziggodome) is op de een of andere manier aan ons voorbij gegaan, geen idee meer waarom. We, is een grote vriend van me en mijzelf. Als sinds 2003 (Gelredome) is proberen we de optredens samen te bezoeken. Het nieuwe album (Moon Shaped Pool) en de hoge verwachtingen die Radiohead oproepen maakten het van te voren al spannend. We hadden afgesproken om van tevoren aan de overkant van de HMH wat te eten en op tijd over te steken om dicht bij het podium terecht te komen. Al bij aankomst om 17:00 zie ik dat er een rij voor de ingang staat. Even moet ik de gedachte verdringen om er bij te gaan staan en dan binnen in de HMH wat te eten. Nee, samen even lekker zitten met een lekkere hap hoort er ook bij. Ik kom aan een tafel terecht waar de rij en het groeien ervan goed te volgen is. M'n onrust neemt me elke blik erop toe. Maar, het bier smaakt goed, het eten ook en we nemen even de tijd om wat te praten. Toch staan we om kwart voor zes ook in de rij die inmiddels veel te lang lijkt om nog redelijk dicht bij het podium terecht te komen. Allers lijkt tergend langzaam te gaan, maar als we binnen zijn is m'n opluchting groot. We staan ongeveer 6m van het podium. In een positie die ik inschat als prima om ook mooie foto's te maken. Het voorprogramma is heel apart. De act Holly Herdon presenteert zich via een projectiescherm als een computer band. Er word geen woord gesproken en de computer muziek, aangevuld met leuke video beelden, wordt enigszins aangevuld met hun vervormde stemgeluid. Een leuke nieuwe vorm van muziek/theater waar vast nog veel in te ontdekken valt. Uiteindelijk is het dan zo ver. Radiohead komt op. Ze spelen in het begin in het begin in het relatief donker. Is dat echt opzet? Heeft dat met de muziek van ""A Moon Shaped Pool"" te maken? Ik kan het niet plaatsen. Er worden 4 nummers van het nieuwe album gespeeld achter elkaar gespeeld. Het was me al opgevallen dat hier strijkers op te horen waren. Ter bevestiging zie ik Jonny Greenwood meteen met een strijkstok op z'n gitaar bezig. Zo gaat dat dus. Het is wel meteen wonderschoon, ondanks dat ik het nieuwe album nog niet zo goed ken. Waar we staan klinkt het geluid perfect, wat aan de harde kant als de muziek luider wordt. Dus optimaal genieten. Er worden relatief veel rustige nummers gespeeld, best gek om te zien, maar als er gas gegeven wordt neemt de magie van de complexe ritmes ook toe. Het unieke van Radiohead is uit te blinken in schoonheid in de simpele klanken als ook in de meest absurde vervlochten complexe ritmes. Op de momenten dat de ritmes naar een climax gevoerd worden is luisteren beleven geworden. Alle gedachten worden weggedrukt door een magische ""soep"" aan geluiden met een biologerend bijna hypnotiserend effect. Bizar. Het eerste hoogtepunt is ""There There"" van ""Hail to the Thief"", er komen drumstellen bij voor zowel Jonny Greenwood als Ed O'Brien. Prachtig! Het maakt bijna niet uit wat ze spelen het is allemaal even mooi en indrukwekkend. Ik heb natuurlijk m'n favorieten, zoals bijvoorbeeld ""The Gloaming"". Zo apart! Het kan natuurlijk niet eeuwig doorgaan, er wordt een korte onderbreking ingelast om toch maar aan te geven dat ook deze avond eindig is. Dan is het ook tijd voor ""Paranoïde Android"". Altijd al zo prachtig, maar nu worden de indrukken maximaal aangevuld met al die fijne herinneringen aan het luisteren naar deze muziek en begint m'n zicht troebel te worden door de tranen in m'n ogen. Een beetje genant is het wel, maar het concert kan niet meer stuk. Thuis overkomt me dat wel als ik intens naar muziek luister, live lijkt de continue registratie van wat er allemaal gebeurt het altijd in de weg te staan aan de volledige overgave aan de emotie. Tot nu dus, dit is me dat niet eerder overkomen, maar het kan dus wel. Dit brengt me naar de band zelf. Hoe  wordt dit effect bereikt? De bandleden zijn op 1 na totaal niet extravert, integendeel. Alleen Thom Yorke heeft regelmatig contact met het publiek. De twee gitaristen staan ver aan de zijkant van het podium hun muziek te maken. Helemaal in de muziek opgaand. De bassist (Colin Greenwood) staat zelfs helemaal achter op het toneel. Geen standaard recept voor verbinding, maar het gebeurt toch. Ik let voortdurend op wat Jonny Greenwood doet. Hij lijkt toch het genie achter al die bijzondere geluiden en ritmes te zijn. Al mag je ritmes van maar liefst 2 drummers (Phil Selway en Clive Deamer) natuurlijk niet onderschatten. Gitaar spelend is het al boeiend, maar hij doet ook veel bijzondere, meestal niet zichtbare bijdrages in zijn hoekje, vaak ook op z'n knieën gek genoeg. Het is toch een totaalshow, daar zorgt Thom Yorke wel voor. Kennelijk bezeten van de muziek brengt hij z'n passie over. Of en toe ook duidelijk plezier hebbend in het enthousiasme van het publiek. Opvallend is dat hij veel instrumenten bespeelde. Vaak ook achter de piano bij de nieuwe muziek. Helaas met z'n rug naar ons en het publiek toe. Een beetje ineen gedoken straalt hij z'n intensheid met z'n stem de de zaal in. Ook zo apart dat het hierdoor niet minder wordt. En dan maakt hij duidelijk dat ze het laatste nummer gaan spelen. Zonder veel schijn excuses of show. Het was goed zo en zo was het. We hebben er mooie herinneringen bij. ",
Radiohead,"It's difficult to overstate how disappointing this was. We paid £75 to see one of the best bands in the world, and were unable to see the stage or get anywhere near the volume one would expect from a stadium performance. It honestly felt as though Radiohead were playing the Man U OT up the road, and we could just about hear the sound drifting over. We moved to the back of the crowd to stand behind the speakers towards the back (stage right). Still incredibly quiet. No atmosphere whatsoever, despite a great setlist from the band. I have heard from others that the AV experience in the front tier was incredible. It wasn't actually clear to me that this upgrade was on offer when I exchanged my tickets from the original MEN event on the 5th. I understand that this section was actually underfilled. I'm sorry, but it is unacceptable to segregate the crowd in this way, and provide the rest of the audience with such an underwhelming gig experience. We all paid premium prices at the end of the day! Without exaggeration, this was honestly one of the worst gigs I've ever attended. At £150 for two tickets (and one was a birthday present), I feel completely mugged off. ",
Radiohead,"I went to a Radiohead show, and I founded god. There's is a reason why the show sold out within minutes. I was on a plane when tickets went on sale, by the time I landed in D.C the show was sold out. I was forced to by resale. The thing to remember about Radiohead is that they've always experimented with different type of sounds from different sources and have been able to incorporate them to their own sound. It is a very sofisticated sound. Being able to see them perform it life is quite a treat. But is also a religious experience. The band become one with its sound and therefor the audience become part of the experience. Visually they are able to incorporate the light show to their sound. Nothing remarkable, but yet essential to the experience. I never had the chance to see them before, (even though I'm a music aficionado), I always have a hard time at arena venues. But I finally came to the realization that this guys will never be at small venues anymore. So I did made the effort to see them at Phillips arena. I was not disappointed, and nether should you. H. ",
Radiohead,"After rain the previous night, the evening of April 18, 2017 was clear and temperate, making for a great evening. Radiohead dove deep into their repertoire, clearly enjoying themselves. Indeed, Thom Yorke was more animated and engaging than I've seen before (sadly, which has been in videos only), interacting with the audience. Much of the playlist came from ""In Rainbows,"" with some new from ""A Moon Shaped Pool,"" ""Kid A,"" and ""Hail To The Thief."" Everything was expertly played and inventive, and the sound was loud and clear, but not overwhelming. They played for two hours, but time seemed to fly by, and the audience would have stayed for four if they were so inclined. The light show was unique but not so much as to distract from the band playing. From what I saw of them at Coachella (streamed live over YouTube), the band was having far more fun at The Greek Theatre in Berkeley, CA. All in all, one of the best concerts I've been to among the many hundreds I've attended over the last 40+ years. ",
Radiohead,"Uno schifo. Loro bravi, questo è scontato. Ma un concerto non è solo il gruppo che suona e te canti. Prezzi alti per cibo e bevande, acqua al costo di 15€ (importo minimo da scambiare in TOKEN), impossibile vedere il palco se non attaccati alle transenne con un PIT che pareva un campo di calcio, stand cibo/bevande tutti attorno all'area del concerto che pareva di essere alla festa del paese per il fastidioso vocio che ne veniva fuori ed inoltre in tasca ho quasi 60€ in TOKEN (quadratini di plastica blu) che non sono rimborsabili e che non possono essere usati negli altri eventi organizzati alla Visarno Arena (a cui ho appunto regalato 60€. Il prossimo concerto doveva essere Eddie Vedder sempre a Firenze ma a cui non andrò perchè ho già regalato il biglietto piuttosto che rimettere piede in quello schifo di posto). Evitare festival e concerti in Italia è il miglior consiglio, in particolare questi tizi. ",
Radiohead,"this was the 8th or 9th time i've seen Radiohead and they get better every time.  I utterly love their serious geekiness, their dedication to playing such beautiful musical melodies with sometimes quite ravey drumming and lights. During Idiotec it's difficult not to dance like an idiot  at their live shows and.  They played Fake Plastic Trees which was wonderful. Thom, Ed and Johnny are so talented and brilliant without trying to obviously entertain you.  I just got back from Mexico where i saw them play to tens of thousands of adoring Mexican fans - all of them singing along - there were some quite emotional moments.  I'm not a particular fan of Creep but when Radiohead do it, they fucking rock it. sorry to swear.  Anyway, definitely one of the best bands i've ever seen live, and i've seen hundreds over the last 35 years. ",
Radiohead,"This was our 3rd time seeing Radiohead; first time at MSG. As expected, they were amazing. A 17 song set followed by 2 encores!!!! They played quite a few songs from “Kid A”, a personal album favorite of mine along with much of the crowd there last night. The acoustics and sound quality were incredible and we enjoyed the light show with the live screen in the back, showing all the band members playing from different angles. They did this at another show we saw a few years ago and were glad to see it utilized again this time. A band that has been around since the 80’s continues to play with heart, passion, and set list/song variety each show. I appreciate them and what they give to their fans- a killer show every time. ",
Radiohead,"After travelling from Perth,  Australia to see Radiohead here in Pittsburgh, They certainly didnt disappoint. I think I can safely say that I was the oldest person in the arena, but it didnt faze me, I was there to see my favourite band,and had waited patiently for this opportunity. Each one of the boys are talented, multi instrumentalists. They just blow me away everytime I listen to them. Thoms voice was brilliant. Love how he moves to the tunes, really getting into it. The only negative thing I can say about the concert, was that it was at least 2 hours too short! Absolutely Amazing! ",
Radiohead,"Radiohead is better live than on recordings.  Their music needs the space an atmosphere of a large arena/stadium to be fully realized.  The musicianship was on point; the lighting effects were brilliant--it was one of the best concerts I've ever seen.  They played from a large swath of their catalog going back to OK Computer, including both hits and deep cuts.  The highlight for me was to actually hear Karma Police live, although closely followed by an emotional True Love Waits.  If Radiohead doesn't come to your hometown, they are worth a long journey to see. ",
Radiohead,"I've actually seen gigs by Radiohead (or members of the band solo) over 100 times since the early days in 1993 - starting with a free gig at Nottingham Trent Uni... that was cramped and sweaty with a mosh pit and just a few glimpses of Thom's blond head bent over his guitar. Since then I've seen Radiohead in venues of all sizes from South Park in Oxford to the Buddokan in Tokyo. Their live shows were phenomenal, full of excitement and tension. I miss them. I've written about a lot of the gigs on my blog http://notrock.blogspot.co.uk/ ",
Radiohead,"Radiohead really didn't disappoint. This was their 2nd show in Oslo and from all reports the set lists were very different. With such a diverse back catalogue there were plenty of twists and turns and the craftsmanship and musical skills on show were something else. My only complaint would be about the sound quality.Oslo Spektrum is renound for being almost impossible acoustically and, although Radiohead almost pulled it off, there was a noticable wooliness to the overall sound. Can't blame the band. The venue just sucks. ",
Radiohead,"Nothing less than perfect. So touching in my opinion, that a band that's been playing for more than 25 years still play with such commitment to the their music, to their crowd and to themselves (at least it seemed that way). It was fun, emotional, upbit, never boring.. my girlfriend is not a Radiohead fan as I am, barely knows their music, and she felt it was the best concert she's ever been to. I'm in love with these guys. ",
Radiohead,"Great concert! Radiohead were great! But I have some issue about the organization... Starting from the movements organization, streets were closed and the railway was not so big to reach all the people that were in the concert. And finishing to the drink and meals available To buy a bottle of water you had to keep 5 coins for 15€ and after that pay one coin(3€) for the water. Is not tolerable . ",
Radiohead,"Amazing, amazing sound quality and visual display! Great length of time played on stage... 3 encores! Spectacular list of songs perform (considering the amount of songs they have) and great atmosphere/mood! Very impressed with this show, the best show I've ever seen and will probabaly ever see... best 20th birthday gift ever! I can't wait to see them again in the future! Ps. Come to Vancouver next time! ",
Radiohead,"The venue itself was a hassle but once on the floor, Junun and Radiohead were great. Awesome energy, Thom was in a good mood and was joking around, and they played an amazing set. Everyone always has certain songs they wish would’ve been played, but the more important part to me was that nothing they played was a letdown, and there definitely were not any weak spots. ",
Radiohead,"Well, I attended night 3 of the nyc shows and my soul flew outta my chest before the main set was over. The crowd was intense and the band ate it up and more than delivered. I’m very lucky to see my favorite band in my hometown center stage 1 row back. I was exhausted after. It was a moving experience and I think the best Radiohead concert I’ve attended so far. ",
Radiohead,"Excellent Gig. Radiohead had the audience eating out of their hands by the fourth track of the set. The crowd played their part too. The ""rain down"" section of Paranoid Android brought goosebumps. Radiohead leave all others trailing in their wake. Masters at work. It's hard to think of anyone who comes close. ",
Radiohead,"Very little chance that there is any artist out there that puts on a more spectacular show in these boys. Love themselves. Show was absolutely stellar. We had floor seats, which I highly recommend spending the extra scratch to make happen, a whole different experience. A lifelong, spiritual experience. ",
Radiohead,Awesome show. Well organized and masterfully performed. A good selection of songs. Obviously I like some albums significantly more than others and was lucky to have them pick a long and diverse setlist. Ultimately it was the encores that really made the show unforgettable. ,
Radiohead,"Memorable! Gran juego de luces, colores y pantallas... Tocan canciones de todos sus discos mostrando cómo han evolucionado. Si solo esperas éxitos, no es el concierto! Tienen tantos disco y canciones que aprovechan toda la discografía para mostrarla a sus fans! ",
Lana Del Rey,"Santo & Johnny were a musical duo from Brooklyn who had a #1 hit with an instrumental song titled “Sleep Walk”. That was back in 1959. Highlights from the Red Rocks season that year included Ricky Nelson and Harry Belfonte. Elizabeth Woolridge Grant wouldn’t be born for another 26 years. She wouldn’t arrive at Red Rocks for another two decades. The first time the young singer-songwriter gazed upon the stage in Morrison, she made herself a promise – one day she would perform on that stage. If I were with her on that day, I would have encouraged the 19-year-old Lizzy Grant, but I wouldn’t have bet on her. Not until I’d seen her shed her skin and become someone else entirely would I have believed she was capable of packing every seat with hysterical, screaming fans. Some will argue that Grant never actually achieved her goal. They will say that the girl who played acoustic guitar and sang coffeeshop love songs had to die in order for someone else to be born. That’s not entirely true though. Lizzy Grant is still very much alive. No matter how self-destructive Lana Del Rey might seem, she is only a character that Grant plays on stage. Living fast, dying young, and leaving a beautiful corpse isn’t a new concept, but it’s also not one Grant lives by. Lana Del Rey is the one who thinks she lives in Brooklyn in the ’60s. She is the one who takes the stage to Santo & Johnny as if they are generational peers. She’s in the little blue dress and designer pumps. She smokes cigarettes and sings songs about sex, drugs and booze. She glamorizes dying young and leaving that beautiful face forever unchanged. Lana Del Rey does all of this so Lizzy Grant can achieve her goals. She does all of this so Lizzy Grant can make a living. Lana Del Rey sacrifices herself so Lizzy Grant can live a long, comfortable life, free from all those tragic things Lana Del Rey sings about. Lana Del Rey is the reason Lizzy has been able to sell out two consecutive shows at Red Rocks. I just hope the thousands of young girls with flowered headbands understand this truth about Lana Del Rey. I hope they understand that the persona is pure entertainment and marketing genius. I hope they understand that she is not a role model. Luckily, my daughter does understand this. That’s why I don’t mind her listening to Lana Del Rey albums and going to Lana Del Rey concerts. But I would be lying if I said it didn’t make me a little nervous to be surrounded by teenage girls last night…each one screaming the following lyrics with such joy… “I got your bible and your gun, And you love to party and have fun. And I love your women and all of your heroin, And I’m so happy now that you’re gone.” - See more at: http://ilistensoyoudonthaveto.com/2015/05/13/endless-summer-tour-red-rocks-05-12-15/#sthash.BKEtxBNa.dpuf ",
Lana Del Rey,"I saw Lana in Brisbane at Riverstage during the Lust For Life tour, and I cannot express how talented she is. The show was amazing, she had an amazing set up and the venue was beautiful, as was her voice. Her opener was BØRNS and his music was a perfect way to open the show and got everyone hyped for Lana. Bless her soul, she came on stage during BØRNS's set and welcomed everyone and thanked us all for showing support for BØRNS, which was a beautiful thing and I can promise you I cried the second she started talking. The $119 was entirely worth it, and although I never made it to the mosh, the lucky souls who got close enough got to take selfies, give her presents, and just talk with her in the middle of her set. She has so much respect for her fans, some of which I met at the show, and they were some amazing people. Lana perfomed songs from all her albums and her sound setup was clear and loud. I wish she had played Groupie Love or God Bless America - And All The Beautiful Women In It, but I got to hear her perform songs I never thought I'd get to hear live and the four years worth of waiting for her to come back to Australia was entirely worth it. If you like her music, I highly recommend taking the opportunity to see her play because she is a literal goddess and that concert blew all my expectations out of the water. By far the best live perfomance I've seen. ",
Lana Del Rey,"Journeying from a small-town singer-songwriter back at age 18, Lana Del Rey skyrocketed through the music industry, landing herself a slot in the top 10 album charts by the age of 21. Her music is noted for its cinematic sounds and reflections on 50s and 60s music culture. Although her live performances can sometimes be slightly pitchy, you can’t blame her performing to such large audiences, and she never fails to put on a spectacular show. Always looking flawless, Lana carries herself with grace and confidence, both appealing characteristics of a live performer. Whilst her live performances are magical and the sound of her beautiful melodies transcends through the audience, in some ways she is an artist meant for recording purposes. Her dulcet tones tend to get lost in a stadium, however this could be the fault of sound technicians rather than Lana herself. Regardless of this, if you are a fan of her music, I would recommend checking her our live, as the emotion that she portrays through her music is extremely powerful to experience first hand.  She also has great moments of interaction with the audience, so if you are able to secure a spot in a front row seat, you won’t be disappointed. ",
Lana Del Rey,"Absolutely phenomenal. I joke with my friends that after going to this concert, it was a night that I had died and became reborn again.    The venue, the Atlanta Tabernacle was beautiful and perfectly fit for her. As a Lana groupie, the amazing connection among the fans there made it feel like I was amongst family. It was almost magical the feeling I received when everyone in the room sang her hits together in unison, because everyone knew all the words. General Admission tickets are encouraged for people who are interested in meeting Lana. She spent so much time talking and taking photos with her fans, signing autographs, everything with her fans. She pays so much attention to them during her concerts, If you have a genuine desire to meet her, I'd say camping out and waiting for hours is definitely worth it. She has her props and they compliment her performance very nicely. Her voice is beautiful live and she sang songs from each of her albums. Although I was disappointed that she didn't sing Yayo or Diet Mountain Dew, as I had hoped. I would easily say that this night was the greatest of my life. So much so, that I purchased tickets for Music Midtown just to see her again. ",
Lana Del Rey,"The show had an excellent, very relaxed vibe. Lana put on an amazing performance and had a number of guest artists come up on stage with her to perform as well. She seemed to be enjoying herself. As always her voice sounded like warm honey and rung out with a powerful yet melancholic air. She truly is like a goddess on this earth. When my ex said she'd leave me for Lana I couldn't even blame her; I'd leave me for Lana too. I wish I had gone with a group of people, instead of alone, so I could more properly enjoy the atmosphere on the floor. The visuals and sound of the concert were good, not too loud (compared to some concerts), and pretty nicely balanced. Overall it was an excellent experience. Only ways it might have been improved for me is: coming with friends, being mildly intoxicated, and being able to actually see the stage properly/being closer to the front, or being on the ground on a blanket or quilt lounging. I definitely recommend experiencing a show of hers if you are a fan and get the chance. Go with friends or a significant other, and enjoy the raw power and energy Lana gives off. ",
Lana Del Rey,"The choice of environment was absolutely perfect, I could see clearly how the medieval castle and the sunset would match Lana's dreamy vocals. The thing is, it took a while for Lana herself to appear. We waited from 3pm to about 7 or 8pm, with the guest appearances of some really weird rapper that couldn't be more different from the main act and the handsome Tamino, who blew everyone away with his music. But when Lana finally showed up on stage it was pure magic. It was very well decorated with her traditional old Hollywood romantic style. Lana was very interactive and talked to the crowd while signing records and posters on long instrumental moments of Venice Bitch. She was as sweet as possible and we were left questioning if it hadn't been all a dream. ",
Lana Del Rey,"I bought my tickets as soon as the presale started and was thrilled to score pit tickets. Unfortunately, the concert I had been looking forward to for months made me miserable. The pit was completely packed with sweaty fans who were drunk and high. During my time there, I got a frozen margarita accidentally poured on me, got puked on, got my hair pulled, butt grabbed, and got my back completely scratched (by fans who thought they would get a better view if they sunk their nails into my skin.) I now know better than to buy pit tickets. I am so sad to say that I left early and couldn't finish seeing my favorite artist because of the terrible pit circumstances. ",
Lana Del Rey,"Lana del Rey is truly a godess. This was my second time seeing her in concert and it did not ever let me down or disappoint me, just like the first time I saw her. She sang beautifully and heavily interacted with the crowd which made it feel personal and intimate. I wish she would have sang more from untraviolence, but I was happy to hear some of the classics again. The only problem I had with this concert was the organization of the venue. There was a ""no lining up"" rule which caused for very hectic and stressed out fans. All in all it was absolutely amazing and I can not wait to see Lana again in concert. I would even go back to this venue for her. ",
Lana Del Rey,"After months worth of hype and buying my tickets as soon as possible, I couldn't wait to see Lana Del Rey, but unfortunately, it wasn't worth the hype at all. Lana's show essentially bored me, and sure, you could argue it was just 'her style' of music. But I've been to quieter shows, and this one just lacked any sort of energy despite having a whole arena in her palm. She singed her melodies with ease, but throughout, I could never get into the music and by the time I could, her set was already over. Overall, Lana is perhaps worth seeing cheap, but at $60 a ticket for mediocre seats, I can't recommend her. ",
Lana Del Rey,"I did not think it was possible but Lana Del Rey sounds even more incredible live than in studio. The only negative thing was that the doors opened pretty early and she came on a little later on so the wait was around 2 hours with no music or support act, however it was completely worth it once the show started and she sounded absolutely angelic. The set list seemed a little short but had a great selection of songs from throughout her career from Born to Die to Ride to Music to Watch Boys to and White Mustang. I'd definitely recommend going to her shows at least once in your life if you are a fan. ",
Lana Del Rey,Seen her live in concert 3 times twice in London and once in Switzerland! Her last concert at Brixton in London was truly amazing and worth the 14 hour queue! Got to me the women herself for the 3rd time and the fact she remembers me every time is still beyond belief! She's the sweetest artist and seeing her run towards me and giving me a big kiss an hug truly was the best! Shame the venue was so loud as we tried to have a quick chat but it was way too loud! She truly graces the stage like no one else! I can't wait to see her live again in Spain next year! Worth every penny! Love you Lana xx ,
Lana Del Rey,"""I can feel the electricity tonight"" -Lana last night at DTE. I went to the show last year in Michigan and it was amazing!..but so unorganized and chaotic. The pit was much more tame this year with true devoted fans (no flower crown summertime sadness chorus  screaming girls like last year's) which made it much easier to lose yourself in her music. She only came to one side of the pit and sadly it was not our side but we got up on the big screen during the show which was awesome! It was an overall controlled, incredible and memorable night, by far the BEST concert I have ever attended. ",
Lana Del Rey,"I cried. I cried shamelessly when this beautiful, amazing, talented, humble being came out. She opened with Cruel World & went into Cola (to which the crowd went wild) While singing Ultraviolence halfway through the show, she walked all the way across the walkway that went into the crowd. She bent down & took selfies with her fans & accepted flowers from all of them. I was in awe that she is so down to earth & shows appreciation to all of her fans. This ticket was worth every penny & now that I have met my idol, I can say that that I can die happy. ",
Lana Del Rey,"Wow. Lana was so amazing, her voice live was so beautiful it sounded just like the record. The show was beautiful, the setlist was so good and in the back, the film clips she had playing really added to the whole thing. The opening act, borns, was also so so so good. He's so talented and beautiful and the whole show was just so amazing. The only negative thing was the crowd, they were pushing and everyone was so compacted, it was im- possible to move. had so much fun though, love them both a lot. ",
Lana Del Rey,"Pros and cons in this gig (Malahide Castle, Dublin, July 2019): Pros - A crowdpleasing set with lots of favorites played, and an artist with clear warmth and rapport with her fans - She looks great, and sings wonderfully Cons: - Quite a short show, no more than 1 hour 15-20mins - Sound was poor in parts, and a feeling of disorganization in the sound set up, with even Lana apologizing more than once for issues with it I’d definitely go to see her again, but probably in a proper music venue. ",
Lana Del Rey,"Such an amazing experience. She is just as beautiful and angelic as she is in pictures. I was so overwhelmed by her beauty and grace. I only wish I had closer seats. Lana hugged, took pictures with and signed items for the people in the first row. Her voice almost sounded better live, than recorded on her CDs. She selected the best songs so that everyone could sing along to and her quirky dance moves made everyone scream. I highly recommend seeing Lana del Rey in concert! Next time I'm buying front row!!! ",
Lana Del Rey,"It was amazing, she's a very talented singer and she was very communicative with the crowd, very carefree but professional at the same time. Amazing show amd dancers, the stage was beautifully decorated. The crowd was huge but got in and out of the concert in a very organized manner. Made a lot of friends. However the opening act (the band before Lana) was not enjoyable. The songs were the same and very boring, the singer didn't have a memorable presence on stage. ",
Lana Del Rey,"seeing Lana was a dream come true. everything was so perfect. the entire atmosphere of the show was so enchanting and despite being seated in a large arena, it felt so intimate and personal. the live version of 'west coast' changed my life, quite literally. it was almost a spiritual experience. the entire show was mesmerizing and so beautiful. other fans were respectful too. that show was probably one of the best nights of my life so far. it was truly amazing. ",
Lana Del Rey,"Delightful! NFR is a masterpiece! This is her best first-to-last work since Ultraviolence. Her concert was around an hour, though she packed in a lot of songs, including a ""double summertime"" (Summertime & Doin' Time), Videogames, and Mustang.  It would take a longer show to include: 13 Beaches, Art Deco, High by the Beach... WAMU :(- 8:00 pm was the time on the ticket.  The doors opened at 8:00, the show (with no opening act) began at 9:00. ",
Lana Del Rey,"I have gone to almost 100 concerts, and this was seriously my favorite concert that I have ever gone too. She is truly a Queen. I really splurged for general admission tickets and it was worth every penny. Her theatrics were phenomenal and words can't describe how magical she sounded live. Truly a magical experience. If you are a Lana Del Rey fan, do yourself a favor and buy a ticket to one of her shows. ",
Kings of Leon,"!!best concert I ever attended!! Everything (support band and kings of Leon themselves) started perfectly on time and it was a great show. The music was way better than any record could ever capture!!  Hitting every note perfectly you could definitely see the band trying to do more than their best while looking so effortless and natural. Somehow every song they performed was ""clearer"" / more refined or nuanced (as you could hear the different instruments creating a song rather than a blurred, smeared sound as a whole) and kind of more intense than on the record: the slow, sometimes sad ones were more touching and really making me feel the emotion created by the music and the faster ones were much more rocking and engaging. The way they incorporated the audience and the atmosphere with everybody in the crowd singing the lyrics along at the top of their lungs, shouting, dancing and jumping around made it a very special event! As I was standing in the front row the whole event was made even more perfect by the fact that I was able to catch not only one but even two of the huge amount of plectrums (not sure wether this is the right plural of this word ^^) that the whole band was throwing in the crowd during their gig and a friend of mine even got a drum stick! All in all it was an evening full of highlights that made me discover a whole new side to their music but my personal favorite and definitely most emotional moment was a 10 minute version of pyro when the band somehow managed to reach every single person in the audience and make them participate (at least they made me feel like it). Finally I want to point out that I personally never was I huge Kings of Leon fan - don't get me wrong, I always liked their music and knew the lyrics to their most common songs (like sex on fire, use somebody and waste a moment) but never got really excited for them like I did for other musicians or was actively listening to them, just once in while when I was feeling like it and then only the songs mentioned above. But this concert definitely changed my feelings towards them and reached something in me emotionally which I didn't even know existed!  I really don't know how they managed to do that but I feel like I see things differently  than before and it was probably one of the best moments in my entire life so far (and I really don't think that anything only close to that will happen to me in the any soon!). I would give everything to see them again soon but I think for me (living in Germany) it was kind of a rare opportunity :( So to sum up I would really recommend to go see them if you have the chance to as it was a revelation to me! At first I thought that the tickets were too expensive but after this performance I would pay more than twice as much to get to experience a concert of them again. ",
Kings of Leon,"When it first came to my attention that Kings of Leon had announced a summer series of one-off shows I knew it was vital that I managed to bag a ticket.    The announcement soon came after the release of their sixth studio album 'Mechanical Bull' which soared straight to the top of the charts instantly after its release. It was inevitable that the show would include tracks from this highly anticipated album, but with the bands huge success since they first burst onto the scene in 2003 it was inevitable that their huge number of singles would also be making an appearance.    Leading up the performance we were treated with support acts 'Twin Atlantic' and 'HAIM' only giving us a small taster of what we should expect later in the evening. Racking up such a huge following over the years it was only expected that fans of the band would come out in force to see the band in person which is quite a rarity.    The set list was carefully selected allowing us to share in their success over the years with a combination of their hits since the start of their career, only ensuring that all the crowds requests were met.    It is true that this band do not interact with the audience as much as other artists do, but what they lack in conversation they definitely make up for in talent. Watching this band live felt monumental, they harbour such a talent and have carried with them their rock roots throughout their time in the industry. Of course their most famous singles 'Sex on Fire' and 'Use Somebody' caused the biggest roar from the crowd all night but combined with their earlier rock ballads, this night was unforgettable.    If you were to take anything away from this review, it would be say yes to buying a ticket to see this band as soon as you possibly can. ",
Kings of Leon,"I had the opportunity to see the Kings of Leon at the Milwaukee Summerfest and other than them coming on late, only singing an hour and a half and not doing my two favorites, I was not disappointed.  Since I'm fairly new to the Kings of Leon, I'm not familiar with a lot of their songs but I still enjoyed them tremendously.  The songs that I knew sounded even better live than they do on their albums and their performance of most of the songs that I didn't know made me want to add those songs to my collection. While they aren't the best vocalists, they are excellent musicians and they showcased their skills throughout the show.  Additionally, from the time the concert began to the time it ended, it was all about the music.  Other than graciously thanking the audience a few times, there was very little dialogue and they truly let the music ""speak"" in its stead. After such awesome showmanship, naturally I was extremely disappointed when they concluded their concert after only an hour and a half, especially after not hearing my favorites.  As a matter of fact, I was so disappointed that I had initially decided seeing them wasn't worth the two and a half hour drive I took to get there plus the cost of the ticket and that I wouldn't see them again.  In hindsight however, I'm glad I went because their performance in and of itself was awesome.  The jury is still out as to whether I'll see them again but at this point, I won't rule it out. ",
Kings of Leon,"Kings of Leon is one of my favorite bands to see live: these guys just tend to have a great time, party, and drink along with the rest of us in the crowd! They have been around for quite a few years and really started taking off in the mid-2000s, but they still know their roots. They are all brothers and cousins so they have a connection all of their own, and Caleb's vocals are like a gateway to let us join in on the family too. They tend to play more arenas and amphitheaters these days since they are so huge, but their sound is perfect for it; these guys rock hard and always leave me walking away satisfied with my ears ringing and a smile on my face. They are another band that don't really rely on visuals and props to supplement their act, they let their instruments and vocals do all of the work, which is all anyone needs. When you see Kings of Leon live, they don't sound totally like they do on their albums, they sound even better. Everyone can sing along to ""Sex on Fire"" and ""Mary"", but their live versions of the songs can be unpredictable and much better to listen to. They mainly play what the crowd wants to hear, basically most of the favorites from the past three albums, but once in a while they will throw in a tune from earlier in their careers. They are always worth seeing when they come around town! ",
Kings of Leon,"Overall excellent concert. The opening band, The Sherlocks, put up a good performance that tied in quite well with what was yet to come. The KOL concert started with a not-so-impressive stage, but as part of the act, as we had to wait 40 minutes for the full stage, lights, animations, etc to be unleashed. The sound was excellent for a pavilion gig, we were on the stands facing frontally to the stage and sound was clear and enjoyable. They played all songs quite similarly to the albums without any major modifications with a great array. The only couple of things that weren't that perfect were the fact that they could have played a few more songs from the Mechanical Bull album, in my opinion would have tied quite well within the concert, and the fact that they didn't address the audience nor engaged with ""us"" for the biggest part of the concert, playing all songs straight without any interruptions, no breaks, no big discourses or presentations, and finishing it in 1:45 hours. Taking into consideration their music and albums, we were expecting the show to reach at least 2 hours, but was still a great experience nonetheless. ",
Kings of Leon,"They were great live! I saw them at the Xfinity center in Mansfield Massachusetts.  The opening band was pretty good (Daniel Rateliff and the Night Sweats). They did about six or seven songs as the opener. Kings of Leon came out to a beating heart intro it was neat. They performed some old ""classics"" such as ""Notion"", ""Use Somebody"", and ""Sex on Fire"". They sounded just like they do on the radio! The lead singer was very professional when the drummer had a flub and they had to stop the song. He just said ""Hey that happens sometimes, live music"". I thought that was cool that he was so chill about it. He talked a bit then they restarted the song. I think the lead singer has one of those voices that is made better live. He sounded good. They had really awesome background screens that changed designs and patterns. The lighting was fun a bit flashy at times but not too much. They ended the night with ""Sex on Fire"" and then did an extra song after that. It was a great night and totally worth the hour and a half drive it took us to get there. :) I would go see them again if given the opportunity. ",
Kings of Leon,"KOL is one of my favorite bands and this was my first time seeing them. Had pit standing tickets and man the show had good energy. I love that they played a lot of their new album as expected but they continued to play their oldies but goodies as well, ending with like 25 total songs played. The songs sounded even better live than the recordings, and their big sound for 4 people was well alive. Their bass guitarist and drumming is a sight to see instrumentally and Caleb's voice was on point. Loved that they played ""immortals"" which is one of my favorites but honestly knew every song and couldn't of asked for a better set list! Great band, great show, I will be seeing them again! ",
Kings of Leon,"Best night of my life!! Was supposed to go see them in 2010/3 but missed them & I was heartbroken! Last night is a night I'll forever remember, I love Kings Of Leon so much! They put on the best show I've ever seen in my life and Calebs smile melted my heart. This band is my life and to of finally seen them made me cry like a baby but I didn't care, I'm so grateful to have seen them play and I'm already looking forward to when they come back, maybe another 3/4 year wait but it'll be perfect! Thank you Anthony Caleb Followill Ivan Nathan Followill Cameron Matthew Followill Micheal Jared Followill I love you all <3 <3 <3 <3 ",
Kings of Leon,"Kings was amazing!!!! Although my roommate and I purchased cheap GA tickets we were able to sneak closer to the front. The show was phenomenal. One kol opened with Closer, the spirit of music came through the amphitheater like a tsunami wave. Cried like a little school girl when they played Tonight. ""Tonight, I'm gonna lose my body"" needless to say the sound of the music reached out and resonated with the underlying ache in my soul. I know the whole crowd was move when they have a shout to Matt followill for his birthday. HANDS DOWN BEST SHOW IVE BEEN TO. I will forever remember Kings of Leon mechanical bull tour 2014!!! ",
Kings of Leon,"They were great! Definitely not a boring band, the music is fun and upbeat, the band members were nice to their fans and audience, and I give them lots of credit for their lighting and video displays which attracts attention. Everyone really loved the way they played and that they not only played from their new album, but oldies as well so everyone can sing along. Their stage was awesome with the video effects and lighting which kept you going. I so recommend going to see them, I won't hesitate for next time! ",
Kings of Leon,I never write reviews honestly. So here it goes! IT WAS THE BEST AND MOST AMAZING THING I EVER DID!! I'm not from around- (From SA) a big dream on my Bucket list was to see Kings Of Leon since I Started Listening to them. It was Worth a long 9 hour drive and I'd do it again without a doubt! Now I have a bigger bucket list Item- to be a VIP! Would'nt that be so amazing! It is really a must see show for big KOL fans you'll not be regretting one moment. Their music is just amazing. A Happy Nicole ,
Kings of Leon,"The sex is on fire and so is Kings of Leon! 2 hours non stop of all the best songs. The set list was a mix of old albums and new songs, keeping the energy high from the beginning to the end. The stage was colourful with pieces of video clips making everything super exciting. The performance of Closer was a total gift that brought the stadium to a colective transe. Amazing concert! ",
Kings of Leon,"This was my first time seeing Kings of Leon live, and they did not disappoint! They played a nice assortment from different albums. They are gracious to the croud and interactive.They have a huge stage presence, sound amazing live, and their light show was like no other! The Atlanta/Lakewood venue though wasn't very impressive. Next time I would travel to Raleigh or Charlotte instead. ",
Kings of Leon,"Sucked. They had a limited amount of time on stage and they played too many slow/sad songs. Should have been playing hits or fun/rockin songs. People were just standing around, not dancing or jumping and having a great time while KOL was on stage. All the other bands were great this year, as well as the past years. We left in the middle of KOL set. ",
Kings of Leon,"I don't care how many thousands of people were there, I felt like that performance was just for me. I laughed, I cried about things that have never even happened, I felt 3085 different feels that I didn't know I had, it was amazing. This was my third time seeing them and it certainly won't be the last. Long live the Kings! ",
Kings of Leon,"I wasn't really into the band going in, only like their hit song ""Sex on Fire"". They sure surprised me and put on one hell of a show! Their performance of Closer just blew me away.    The Kongos also put on a great show and I was honored to be among the first of crowds that witnessed them perform at Red Rocks. ",
Kings of Leon,Amazing show last night due to - brilliant voice by lead singer due to 3days break of no concerts beforehand -amazing sound engineering as venue is soundwise difficult - visuals screens lighting really really nice. - served a broad spectrum of songs from all their albums so far ,
Kings of Leon,Amazing live band! Played all of.tje favorites with some.new stuff sprinkled in. They sounded great. My daughter's first concert..they earned another fan for life!! The venue is good..the lawn is a laid back place to dance or chill in your chair. Great experience..we loved it!! ,
Kings of Leon,I saw king's of Lyon as part of Fusion Presents where several excellent band's all seemed to be competing with each other for who could be the best act. king's of Leon were the headline act and were fantastic. I would highly recommend seeing them live score out of 9/10 ,
Queen,"Queen and their mercurial frontman were simply the best band ever live, and believe me I have watched more than a few. May 7th 1978 Stafford New Bingley Hall: a huge agricultural-looking barn in the middle of nowhere was suddenly transformed into a mind blowing theatre of music at about 8pm. A song somehow resembling “We Will Rock You” but played at a frenetic speed burst out of the speakers and the mass of lights and dry ice. Suddenly the stone-cold, crazy-paced lyrics of WWRY were assaulting our eardrums and then suddenly Freddie appeared out of the mist and on to the end of the central catwalk clad head to foot in a then-unfamiliar black leather outfit and cap - the boys were clearly here to rock. From this beginning an already ardent fan was hooked for life. Concerts in 1979 at Birmingham, Manchester and the best gig of all time, Ally Pally, would follow as Queen took their Crazy tour across the UK and further gigs in the years to follow - but I will never forget that initial burst on to the stage and my first glimpse of the greatest showman of all time. ",
Queen,"I had been looking forward to this for ages. Between the ages of 13 and 15 I religiously spent all my money at HMV buying all Queen's records and live dvds. Spent my young teenage evenings listening to all the records - learning all the words. I was mesmerised. I've not listened to them regularly for years, but I remember those nights right now like they were yesterday. I'm now stood here, surrounded by people that don't know any of the words to Stone Cold Crazy, watching Brian May and Roger Taylor look like a couple of dilapidated old guys doing an appearance at the end of Pop Idol where that week's winner gets to sing their party piece song with the original band as a treat. I didn't realise it until now standing here close to tears, but John Deacon had the right idea. Queen died on the 24th of November 1991 and they were the best band ever. ",
Queen,"I went to the first Melbourne concert on 02/03/18. What a mind blowing experience it was!! The boys were in their element - high energy talented musicians. Adam was super fantastic singing out the front and was on point capturing the essence of Queen's songs. Freddie would be super super proud of the boys performance on the night as were all of us listening,dancing to the music and remembering him prancing about on stage in his magnificent costumes Best bits were Adam's shiny silver outfits,Brian's guitar solo that seemed to go on forever. Roger's drumming and singing throughout the night. The lighting was like New Years Eve fireworks! Really everyone on stage and off stage were magnificent and made it a very memorable experience 10 out 10 from me. If they are in your area,spend your money and buy a ticket,you won't be disappointed. ",
Queen,There are rock stars and then there are rock gods. Mr May and Mr Taylor fall easily in to this category. Add to them a complete upstart in Adam Lambert and you have what I can only desribe as pure and utter genius. Yes the songs are all now getting on in age but the sheer fact that you hear the songs day after day everywhere shows the quality of the music this band has produced over the last 40 plus years. The show itself was musically and visually stunning. Adam Lambert openly admits he is no Freddie Mercury but he is vocally stunning and so well suited to this band. The appeal of Queen to all ages is undeniable and the audience was testament to this fact covering ages from 12 to 70. I have now seen Queen  a total of 5 times and somehow they just seem to get better. Please see them you will not regret it. Long live QUEEN. ,
Queen,"The Queen show and lineup is a must see. Adam Lambert is a good second to the great Freddie Mercury although Freddie will never be replaced. I've seen Queen with Freddie and they always have a great light and stage show. This light and stage show is one of the best I've seen lately. It's worth the price of admission. Brian May lit the stage up with his trememdous guitar playing. He's one of the greats. Roger Taylor has always be a favorite of mine on the drums and kicked so butt on this concert with his solo. The only disappointing thing about the whole experience was the 45 minute wait. If you are suppose to start the concert at 8pm, there is no need to start it at 8:45pm. Other than the late start time, this Queen show was great. ",
Queen,"Wow! You know Queen is the Queen of showmanship. They outdo all others! Trap doors in the stage, screens to project laser images, pedestals to lift musicians, a huge disco ball, lasers, lights, confetti, and costume-changes are all fantastic. Adam Lambert is an amazing asset to this band, which includes his humility and humble love for the band and the audience. His personality of flamboyance and attitude compliments the show in a fantastic way. Loved every minute of it. Of course there are Freddie moments in this show that also will bring a tear to your eye cos you know you miss him so much. This was the best show I have seen in a very long time, if ever. It makes me regret not being able to see them in their hey day in the 80s. ",
Queen,"From the intro to we will rock you to the final song which i cannot remember this show with 2 legends of British rock music was everything i had hoped it would be and so much more. The massive stage production made the show even more impressive. The vocals of Adam lambert make the band sound a little different to the late great Freddie but in his own words "" i can only hope to be as good as the rock god"" If you have seen the band before you know how great they are live, if  not they are a band that has to be seen live to know just how amazingly talented they are. I really do hope there is another tour so i can go to see the wonder that is Queen. ",
Queen,"Saw Queen + Adam Lambert last night in Newcastle and honestly it was the best concert i have attended. Sadly i am too young to have seen Freddie however i know that no one will ever be quite like him but Adam Lambert is definatly the best suited to tour with Queen. His flamboyant nature, witty comments and overall persona fit the part so well and his vocals were fantastic. Also the performance from Brain May singing Love Of My Life brought a tear to my eye with Roger Taylors vocals being amazing as well. Overall the show was perfection and i would happily pay to see them again tomorrow ! ",
Queen,What a spectacular show!  All of my favorites were played along with a couple of new favorites.  Although difficult to choose from Brian May being elevated up with the planets or Adam Lambert arising from the floor on the motorcycle - I'd have to say the most memorable moment was when Brian May was about to sing/play the acoustic version of Love of my Life and he said we could all use a little light in our lives and the whole place lit up like a waterfall of light!  It almost made my heart burst and will be one of my many concert moments that will remain in my memory bank forever! ,
Queen,This concert was the exceptional. The stage and especially the lighting were superb. The song choices were not the ones I had expected them to sing but were a perfect choice starting with We will Rock you which got everyone in the right mood for the rest of the show. My favourites would have to be Love of my Life which the audience mostly sang with a little help from Brian May so I think was the star of the show Radio Ga Ga and my all time favourite Bohemian Rhapsody which brought the house dow and got the entire stadium standing. All in all it was the concert of the year for me. ,
Queen,Fantastic show as always. Adam Lambert is a perfect partner for their vast back catalogue. Hit after hit came along with Roger and Brian performing their own numbers as well. Roger and Adam’s duet of Under Pressure was amazing. The light show and special effects were the most technologically advanced I have seen in a live show. This may be their last time around so I was very happy to have been part of this phenomena ,
Queen,Great show!  I wasn't sure about the Adam Lambert lead but he was great!  My only complaint was they started 45 minutes after the show was supposed to begin.  By then we were all getting a bit restless.  Didn't take long for them to win us all back over though.  Another thing I can say is I've never heard a crowd sing along so loudly.  It was a sight to see and hear!  I would go see them again in a heartbeat! ,
Queen,"Great performance and great show. The sound and vocals wasn't imnpressive to begin with but at Killer Queen, the sound and Adam Lambert really opened up, and the rest of the concert was top notch! I thought it was strange that no tribute was given to John Deacon. He might not be dead but he is also Queen. Why wait until death to pay tribute to those who deserve it? ",
Queen,"Gig of the year for me. The old rockers rocked like the old days with help from Adam Lambert. I had reservations about him after seeing Queen with Paul Rodgers but this lad puts on a Freddie style flamboyance that gives Brian & Roger that Freddie feeling. Queen at their best - and I’ve seen them before their best and at their very best. If they tour again, go! ",
Queen,"It was an amazing show. I had side view seats high up and I could see everything perfectly. every feature was planned to perfection, costume changes, lights, solos, the stage. I was crying most of the concert I was so happy. All in all a really wonderful show with lots of audience interaction! I would definitely go again!! Five stars ",
Queen,performance was great the only complaint i have is the echo in the cheap seats (i couldn't afford the more expensive tickets.) the venue isn't set up for concerts as it is set up for football and as such there is a large echo under the dome seating. fantastic performance loved it. not bands fault about the echo. ,
Queen,"Went to the show last night not knowing what to expect.  I left blown away by the experience.  Brian May and Roger Taylor were incredible and Adam Lambert was the complete showman.  They played all the hits and left the crowd wanting more, including myself.  I think they have made Freddie proud. ",
Queen,"This Conway’s absolutely ind blowing. I remember Freddie Mercury and wasn’t sure that Adam Lambert could step up to the mark. Believe me he did more than that! What a voice and what a presence, he was more than wonderful! What a concert....,absolutely amazing xxx ",
Queen,"That was the BEST show of my life, by far. It was a one time life experience, thanks to Brian May, Roger Taylor, and all the QUEEN staff. Also many thanks for the staff at the Zalgirus Arena.THe light shows, the sound and everything was perfect. ",
Queen,"This was the best night of my life ! I was nervous that Adam Lambert was singing in place of Freddy Mercury, but he was fantastic. It was amazing and the light and image coordination really put the event from a concert to a show; just breathtaking. ",
Ellie Goulding,"Ellie Goulding is now a household name in both her UK homeland and the US thanks to the success of 'Lights'. Her live show is now a melange of cult favourites that propelled her to stardom such as 'Guns & Horses' with the commercial pop/production driven mega-hits such as 'Burn'. Ellie tackles each track with the same form of intensity, from the opening reverberations of 'Don't Say A Word' she stands with determination centre-stage and delivers each note with proud intonation in that unique vocal style. 'Figure 8' is a highlighted moment as she forcefully beats her snare drum with aggressive force as the crowds cheer her on. A tender cover of Active Child's 'Hanging On' chills the air in the venue as her pained vocal hits every single note on point. She winds down her main set with a plethora of hits which now include 'Anything Could Happen', 'Starry Eyed' and 'I Need Your Love', her collaboration with Calvin Harris. 'Lights' makes for a dramatic encore as from the intro the audience cheer and dance as Ellie launches into an extended version as the track breaks down into a piece of house/dance. It's no secret that Ellie's musical style has changed since breaking the States, yet her credibility and intent as a musician remains solid. ",
Ellie Goulding,"I'm finding it so hard to find words that perfectly describe last night's #deliriumworldtour concert. It was wonderfully balanced with a range of Ellie's more upbeat, EDM tracks and also her lighter, more relaxed numbers (including a handful of beautiful acoustic sounds). With the odd spot of conversation between songs proved how human and raw Ellie actually is (unlike some singers who do nothing to interact with their audience) and it really added to the intensity and uniqueness of the performance. The atmosphere created was very tense and enjoyable; it felt both exhilarating and relaxed depending on the song and mood. As an audience, I could see that everyone had really connected with the performance and performers-whenever Ellie was speaking, everyone was silent, listening intently to her. That bond that we had with her and the band was very special and singular. I could go on and on but I'll just end by saying by far, this is the best concert from Ellie that I have ever experienced. I really wish I could relive it again and again! Tegan Steward ",
Ellie Goulding,"Ellie Goulding is one of the most talented, biggest artists to emerge from England these past few years. She has one of the most authentically and uniquely beautiful voices I have ever heard live, a rare gift for many famous singers these days, most of who are heavily manufactured. Better yet, because she writes her own songs, you can actually feel genuine emotion in her voice when she sings and it is clear that her songs have meaning. Indeed, Ellie performed a range of songs including some of her earlier tracks that are less well known, and it was these more obscure songs that often felt the most emotive and real. Nonetheless, hits such as ‘Burn’, ‘Anything Could Happen’, ‘I Need Your Love’ and ‘Lights’ were still all great to listen to and the crowd reaction for each was fantastic, creating a great party atmosphere as the crowd danced and sang along. ‘How Long Will You Love Me’ was a nice acoustic break and was performed beautifully, as was Fifty Shades of Grey hit ‘Love Me Like You Do’, which caused mass swaying. ",
Ellie Goulding,"Amazing...! Ellie was in fine form. Singing was bang on, dancing was in her own usual ""don't give a f**k"" style. Her dance team managed pauses for costume changes well and it didn't feel intrusive, as it sometimes can. Her set ranged from much loved classics such as burn, right through to an acoustic version of Devotion from her new album (which was far superior to the more ""dance"" oriented album version) and everything in between. John Newman was the main support act, but felt a little out of sorts. Years and Years are supporting the US leg of the tour and I feel they would have been a better choice to support in Europe as well. ",
Ellie Goulding,"I am used to watching Ellie Goulding in small intimate gigs which are very personal and usually key to hearing her raspy and elegant tones. Slightly neverous if the O2 areana wouldn't give her the credit she deserved, I was completely blown away how amazingly she filled the whole stadium with sound while still having intimate moments on the slower Ballards. The intros/outfit change videos were perfectly edited and incredibly creative! Always been a fan but massive respect for this (super) woman now just proving how she can rock and fill any stadium. One of the best gigs I've seen at the 02 to date! ",
Ellie Goulding,"I saw Ellie Goulding back in 2011 at the House of Blues in Boston and it was one of the best shows I have ever been too. It was right before the the record Lights blew up stateside and you just knew she had what it takes to be big time. Bag raiders were the opening act and it helped set the tone for an energetic and really fun evening.  Ellie's voice is incredible live and the performances were so upbeat and energetic. If you are looking for an incredibly talented singer but still want to move your groove, I would recommend seeing Ellie Goulding. ",
Ellie Goulding,"What an amazing experience! The production value was super high, opening with an ethereal video until Ellie Goulding herself appeared on the stage in smoke and color. If you like her music, you'll be blown away seeing her live. She's an even better vocalist than her albums suggest. She's also a great performer in general, even if she gets nervous talking to the audience. It was great to hear the stories behind the songs. The whole thing was just the greatest dance party. I'm still finding confetti from it weeks later! ",
Ellie Goulding,"The show was amazing! Including the opening by Bebe Rexha and Years & Years Ellie has an amazing voice. Too bad some people were inconsiderate, drunk, smoking weed and kept interrupting me and my friends from having fun. I got beer spilled on my foot, a pretty hard hit on the head and smoke all over me. I was being pushed and hit repeatedly the entire night by these people.  I mean I would have expected this at the club. But at an Ellie Goulding Concert? I'm never going to the pit again. I just wanted to see Ellie. ",
Ellie Goulding,"The concert was amazing. Years and Years had opened up for Ellie, along with Bebe Rexha and it was well worth the wait. I would pay even more to go again. The GA pits were wonderful and I had a nice view the entire time, the ticket prices were also extremely well priced. Ellie Goulding is a amazing performer and there was not a dull moment in the show. I plan to attend many many more Ellie Goulding concerts  thanks to Songkick. ",
Ellie Goulding,"I can't believe I could see Ellie Goulding with my eyes in front of me in that stage. It was a dream become true. Moreover, I loved the performances from John Newman and Olly Alexander. I hope many people being homeless have the opportunity to have a happy Christmas and someone who spend it with them. Ellie, I love ur voice and the talent u have to convey ur feelings to people. I hope I can see u again soon. ",
Ellie Goulding,"I dont think Ellie could have picked better artist to play before her, Lany were just amazing, John Newman was just awesome but Ellie Goulding was just out there, shes amazing singer. even better in person than on her albums. I loved all her songs she sang.Ii went with my sister and mum and they both loved it as much as I did. I would love to see Ellie goulding again and a million times over. Loved it X ",
Ellie Goulding,"The Ellie Goulding concert was absolutely incredible!  The theatrics were amazing, and so were the backup singers and dancers.  Ellie's voice was absolutely astounding; even better than on her album!  I love how she finished the show with he showers of confetti from the front.  This concert was one of the best I've ever been to, and I was not disappointed at all!  I would definitely see her live again. ",
Ellie Goulding,"Ellie Goulding has incredible stage presence and energy. The way she interacts with the crowd makes the experience so personal and every moment kept me on the edge of my seat. Her band, backup singers and dancers all came together to make the show even more entertaining and were all very talented. If my country is lucky enough to have her again, I definitely won't be missing out. ",
Ellie Goulding,"I have been meaning to see Ellie for almost 7 or 8 years now, and I finally got the chance! Her voice and visual effects were ON POINT and several times brought me to tears (nostalgia). The only thing I didn't like was the 50 Shades of Grey song being her finale, there are way better songs for her to exit with a bang! I'd pay to see her again and again. ",
Ellie Goulding,yup she have a awosme voice literly when i listen first time i feel something different and after that when i want to listen music m heart and mind didnt find other singers name just her name in my mind dont know how and didnt know what is that mostly i noticed when i listen her i feel something different dont know whats that feelings ,
Ellie Goulding,"Went to see her in Leeds on Tuesday night, there were 3 artists in total, we didn't bother with the first and came in at the start of John Newman who i thought would of been good but he was rather disappointing. Ellie was fantastic all round, particularly her slower songs were better live but the variety was great. ",
Ellie Goulding,"Ellie Goulding's concert was AMAZING!!! For her concert to be my first, I was super impressed and elated to have been able to experience it! It was so awesome to see how much she loves what she does in person and how talented she is!  She is a great performer and I really enjoyed myself! Thank you Songkick! ",
Ellie Goulding,"My daughter and I saw Ellie in Prague at the end of January and couldn't wait to see her again. From start to finish the staging, production and performance were fantastic and the dhort chats with the audience brought some intimacy which brought the audience closer. Can't wait until she tours Europe again! ",
Ellie Goulding,"Perfect show where I got good seating tickets. Lights, backscreen images/show were impressive. Unfortunally the arena wasnt full and the floor in front of Ellie was only half full. Why not allow people with seating tickets to enter the floorarea? That would make the total experience much better. ",
Ellie Goulding,"Great concert, she gave it her all, shame was that nobody was really there, i was literally in the middel of 200 ten years olds with their parents, food and drink very exspencive and it was hard to be outide in line since it was so cold, she could if done it earlier, it started at 21:00. ",
Mumford & Sons,"My Mumford travels for round 5 took me to Columbia, Maryland for their Amphitheater gig at the Merriweather Post Pavilion. The Mumford's were rocking a new sound and new style since last I had seen them. They abandoned their signature banjo for their third album, and decided to plug in for an electric based record. It's different for sure. That album, entitled Wilder Mind, was well on display this night. Marcus Mumford and company performed 10 of the 12 songs from the May release. This included 5 of the first 7 songs on the evening, showing Mumford has very much bought into this new style. It's a completely different look for the band. They have a touring drummer with them, on a separate kit from Marcus. At times all 4 of the original band members are just jamming on their electric guitars and basses. My personal favorites of the new material is slow rolling 'Monster' and album opener 'Tompkins Square Park.' I'll also give credit to a cool version of 'Just Smoke,' where the band received help from openers The Maccabees. For me though, the best songs on the evening were the ones from the bands original albums. They obviously have a different feel to them, and the crowd is much more into those tunes. The biggest song a long of the night was by far 'Awake My Soul.' The loudest ovations of the night, I would say were for 'The Cave' and 'Little Lion Man,' both off the debut. Lead singer Marcus Mumford did a good job of mixing in the older material with the new. 'Lover of the Light' and 'Dust Bowl Dance' both added some familiarity after a series of new tunes. Marcus is one of the most impressive frontmen in my opinion. Not only does he sing, but he's going back and forth with acoustic and electric guitar, while operating a kick drum. He even goes over to the set and plays a full drum kit on a few tunes. One thing that surprised me was the attitude of former banjo player turned guitarist Winston Marshall. In my past Mumford show experiences, Winston has always been the lovable banjo player who's smiling, getting the crowd going, and making jokes on stage. I'm not sure if he was having a bad night, but he was oddly quiet. There was no interaction between himself and the audience on the evening. The rest of the gang voiced their appreciation though and put on a great set. The encore was phenomenal. After three favorites, the Mumford's ripped through new single 'The Wolf' as the final song on the night. I believe this was the best tune. The rocking guitars and whaling chorus make it seem more like a punk song with a Mumford appeal. It was a great ending. Another awesome show from Mumford, but nothing topping that Babel tour. I like the new album, but not as much as those original two. It'll be interesting to see what direction the guys go from here. But still a worthwhile show. CONCERT RATING: 4 Stars ",
Mumford & Sons,"La premessa è questa: sono un grandissimo appassionato dei Mumford al punto da conoscere tutti gli accordi delle loro canzoni (le 15 più belle) e mi sono letto il libro che ha ispirato gran parte dei primi 2 album, e sicuramente ""Timshel"", East of Eden di John Steinbeck (un capolavoro). Questo non per tirarmela (perchè non me ne frega niente) ma per cercare di rendere valida e affidabile questa recensione. Lo scenario era quello dell'Arena di Verona, uno dei migliori. L'avevo già sperimentato in passato e l'idea di vedere i Mumford all'Arena con il loro stile rustico... bè, mi gasava parecchio. Voto concerto: 6/7 Il problema principale è stato chiaro fin dai gruppi in apertura: erano mixati male. O il fonico era ubriaco o le attrezzature del Service erano scarse. Le casse ""sfrittegavano"" e con questo termine intendo il rumore che si sente quando vanno in picco con una determinata frequenza emettendo un suono distorto e fastidioso, quasi grattassero le casse. I bassi erano sparati troppo in alto e le casse non reggevano. Speravo che ci fosse un'equalizzazione diversa rispetto ai gruppi di apertura ma mi sbagliavo. Per tutto il concerto il problema è persistito. Oltre ai bassi anche la voce era troppo forte e in tutto questo mancavano dal background musicale il banjo e la chitarra di Marcus. Vi lascio immaginare le parti di sola voce e chitarra... erano un pò tristi. Trombe e violino apparivano e sparivano. In realtà per tutto il concerto si è sentito un evidente cambio di volumi per cercare di aggiustare il tiro. Inutile dirvi che non ci sono riusciti. Vi assicuro che una buona acustica cambia tutto. Ma parliamo invece di cose serie: i Mumford!! In realtà loro hanno suonato bene, hanno fatto la loro parte. Qualche classica cagatina con il pubblico e qualche piccolo effetto scenico. Come i Coldplay, sono scomparsi e riapparsi in mezzo al pubblico per suonare qualche pezzo acustico. Di per sè non erano troppo originali nel coinvolgimento, ma ci poteva stare. Altra grande pecca era l'assenza di maxischermi. Si vedeva bene il palco ma le loro facce non si distinguevano troppo, secondo me avrebbero dato il loro valido contributo nel coinvolgere emotivamente. Stecca clamorosa di Marshall su ""Monster"" (canzone da limone duro). Grandi assenti dal repertorio BABEL, SIGH NO MORE e TIMSHEL. Mi hanno tolto le mie ragioni di vita :-( C'erano tutte le condizioni per renderlo perfetto... ma mi aspettavo un pò di più. ",
Mumford & Sons,"It was songs like Little Lion Man & Roll Away you Stone that initially captured my interest in the band. Sigh no More & Babel shared the same vibe with folk elements & some big hooks. For those whose only exposure to the band is these two albums the new tour may surprise some expecting a banjo laden party atmosphere. This is a band that seem intent to break people’s concept on who they are, the third album Wilder Mind changed the game by ditching the acoustic guitars & plugging in the electrics but the distinct Marcus Mumford vocals ever present & the heart of the band still intact. The new album Delta is with out question a brave step for the band & it will no doubt have its critics as the electro-pop & r&b elements will surprise everyone. After seeing them perform a lot of the new material last night those that don’t give the new album a second chance are missing out. The stage & lighting makes everyone feel like part of the show with the stage in the center of the venue & giving the band the option to go to perform to any section of the crowd they choose. Guiding Light, Slip Away, Rose of Sharon & Delta are the stand out tracks on the album for me & most of these were performed at Glasgow last night. It’s a show and a production that needs to be seen to be believed, massive spectacle, clearest sound I’ve heard live & lighting design & fireworks making for a set that you couldn’t take your eyes off. Gutted for those that had booked for the upcoming shows that have been postponed due to “technical & logistical issues” but trust me when they do perform for you it will be well worth the wait. Top marks gents, first time seeing you live but definitely will not be the last. ",
Mumford & Sons,"I've been a fan of Mumford & Sons since the release of their debut album, Sigh No More. I was captivated by their lyrics and instrumentation, and I never knew I could like folk-influenced music until I heard of them. Although I like their first album better, Mumford's sophomore album, Babel, is still great. On the second night of Lollapalooza last year, I got to listen to the lead singer's (Marcus) flawless voice, and seeing the band in the flesh was like a dream. It was such a beautiful night that I will always remember.    My friends and I were in the process of recovering from Kendrick Lamar's show as we slowly headed over to the stage where Mumford & Sons were playing. There was an unbelievable amount of people who came out to see them. The crowd stretched all the way up to the road leading to the main area of the park. We decided not to immerse ourselves in the pit since we were still tired from the last concert, so we sat in an area where people were more spread out. It was so relaxing listening to Mumford under the city lights. I could see on the big screens how happy the band was as they played for us. The most memorable part of the concert was when they performed ""Lover of the Light."" Everyone was singing the chorus, and as the song started to build, there suddenly were fireworks behind the stage, lighting up the Chicago skyline with euphoric colors and light! It was such a beautiful and exciting sight too see. I'm still amazed at how perfectly timed it was. The crowd was so happy; none of us expected to experience a concert and a fireworks show at the same time. I'm so glad that I got to chill with Mumford & Sons after an upbeat day full of concerts. ",
Mumford & Sons,"Mumford and Sons are probably the best live band of the millennium. Their performances are always electrifying with boundless energy that resonates through whatever venue they are playing. I'm lucky enough to have seen them 13 times in their evolution, from playing their second ever gig in the Union Chapel supporting Laura Marling, to wowing 500 people in a barn for an album launch party where the crowd got to do barn dancing with the band after they performed. Now they can headline Glastonbury and they made their very own Gentlemen of the Road festival which might sadly be the last show I'll have seen them at, depending on whether they return from their ""hiatus"". When Mumford and Sons perform they always have a magic onstage and a surprise up their sleeves, usually bringing onstage all support bands or other bands at festivals they've played together with for an encore, wowing the crowd with stomping intense versions of Fleetwood Mac - The Chain or The Beatles - Hey Jude or With A Little Help From My Friends. Mumford and Sons live is a completely different experience from the commercial radio product most people know. They're the greatest songwriters of their generation and their folk bluegrass anthems pump infectious positive energy through every living breathing soul that witnesses this live experience. After Glastonbury 2013 the hype and the sales figures behind Mumford and sons trounced the Rolling Stones. That just about says it all. And they're amazing lovely funny guys. ",
Mumford & Sons,"Mumford & Sons have had an interesting rise to the cult following they now attain. The British audiences first of all embraced their own brand of traditional alt-folk and made the debut album 'Sigh No More' a commercial and critical success. The Americans soon followed suit with their combined unashamed love of country and everything they consider to be twee and British, Mumford & Sons seemed a perfect match. Now their live show has taken them to some of the biggest stages on both sides of the Atlantic with the stomping folk of the debut and follow-up 'Babel'. A Mumford concert is quite an unusual affair as the audience is constantly drifting between the hoe-down high energy of 'Little Lion Man' and 'Winter Winds' to the solemn and poignant 'Timshel' and 'Ghosts That We Knew'. There are moments of dark intensity in the form of 'Thistles & Weeds' and the epic main set closer 'Dust Bowl Dance'. Despite a slight misfire during their Glastonbury headline set, Mumford & Sons have an integrity and craft in the way in which they make music that is often difficult to find in the 21st century. ",
Mumford & Sons,"19.05.2016 / Vienna Stadthalle - Mumford & Sons: it was an excellent concert, really unforgettable!! what a magic performance! from the first second totally flashed and fascinated! incredible atmosphere...marcus, ben, winston & ted rocked vienna stadthalle!...and the audience really loved the guys,- there was an incredible good energie,- 2 hours full with their brilliant songs: a wonderful mix of old and new songs, full with heart and soul touchings masterpieces..goose bumps at every song! i really hope that mumford & sons will soon come back to austria! for all who love the great music of mumford & sons,- if you ever have the possibility to see a live concert - take the chance - you must see mumford & sons live at least once in your life....to be impressed and fascinated! thank you so much for these great moments..i wish i could turn back time and see them again...unique concert! ",
Mumford & Sons,"Wow, what a show!  Right from the start Mumford had huge energy, with a Stadium-era performance I haven't heard in years.  All the hits interspersed with intimate moments.  Highlights included Marcus running up from the floor of the Hartford XL center (hockey rink) to the upper decks all while singing, hugging fans, waving to the audience from the balcony.  Wow!  The crowd knew every tune and and sang along to most.  Foot stomping, clapping high energy crowd.  The encore blew me away.  At the start, the band members went up to an upper deck balcony with one microphone, and sang a set a capela.  Totally soulful, intimate, and engaging.  Then they returned to the stage and kicked it into high gear with pyrotechnics, ear shattering volume and energy.  They are one of top live performance bands to come about in decades! ",
Mumford & Sons,"It was amaaaazing!!!! Such a great crowd, jumping and singing together to every song, it was a wonderful experience. I have seen Mumford & Sons quite a few times, this was definitely a very special one. It was also the first time I saw the new 360 stage setup, and I absolutely loved it! The members are constantly moving around and with the beautiful lights, design and great sound it is a completely different and exciting level of a live show. This setup makes you feel a lot more ‘closer’, it’s like you’re a part of it all. I am very happy I have the chance to see then again soon at another stop of the Delta Tour, can’t wait! This is something everyone should experience at least once (but preferably tons) in their lives! :) ",
Mumford & Sons,"Mumford and Sons are a live band that never disappoint. The passion that goes into each performance is incredible. Crowd pleasers like ""I will wait"" ""little lion man"" and ""the cave"" will have you jumping up and down fist pumping along with a sea of Mumford loving fans. Mumford started off their career as a cult band playing small venues to less than 100 people now on their arena tours all over the world they still manage to create a gig vibe where you feel a connection to the band. No crazy pyrotechnics no backing dancers or costume changes Mumford are just 4 lads with the occasional drummer or fiddle player joining them on stage who create a mind blowing performance everytime. ",
Mumford & Sons,"When Mumford announced their hiatus, I couldn't have been more heart broken. I couldn't wait for new material and a chance to see them perform. So when I heard they were releasing a new album and announcing a world tour, I was beyond excited. The show exceeded all of my expectations. It was with out a doubt one of the most energetic and incredible concerts I have ever been too. The love from the fans was whole heartedly reciprocated by the band. They where incredible! They are such great performers and musicians and hearing their music live was absolutely amazing! If you are a fan of Mumford, you have to see them perform live. No question about it. ",
Mumford & Sons,Worst gig I've ever been to as me and my friend were refused entry into the genting area on the basis we we apparently we were intoxicated however we had only had a couple of drinks before the event.The security team roughly manhandled us away and even people in the queue around us where asking the security guys why we were being refused entry as we had done nothing wrong! Have tried to contact the arena today with no joy and have been transferred to many departments none of whom know what to do for me.Have even been to the venue this afternoon but found it to be closed. Will be putting my case into writing and shame on you Genting arena! ,
Mumford & Sons,The concert was amazing. It out shone all my already high expectations. It felt like they gave their all for the entire two hours every minute was perfection. The venue and effects gave a great atmosphere. The pre-band Bears Den was good definitely worth giving another listen too. I come from South Africa and this was the highlight of my stay in Germany. I hope that the band would consider visiting my beautiful county in the near future so that I can share this experience with my fellow people.The only bad remark I have is that the beer was far to expensive. ,
Mumford & Sons,"It was magical, Mumford & Sons were utterly incredible; they sound amazing live! Marcus even ran throughout the crowd, I mean to the top of the stadium, right past my friend and I who caught it on video. The other artist who performed were amazing; BORNS also sounded fantastic live and so did Beatenberg (who I heard for the first time at the concert). Mumford & Sons announced that they would not be playing in NY for a while so I am glad that we caught the concert. Can't wait for their return, we will definitely being going to their next concert! ",
Mumford & Sons,"BEST SHOW EVER! I had the VIP experience and it was well worth it. The early entrance to the venue made for an amazing experience. I love how they had the stage in the middle so a bunch of fans could be front row and also how they had the side stages where fans in the LOGE could get a good view as well. Mumford killed it with their setlist. I had chills during some of the songs. They closed the show with Delta and it was UNREAL. They put on such a good show. I would see them live time and time again. Honestly, best concert I've ever been to.. ",
Mumford & Sons,"Incredible concert with Mumford & Sons. Nice mix of not so old and new. Very courageous Mumford to wander off in the crowd. Loved the ""Encore"" touch at the end where he surprised us at the other end of the stadium with an ""unplugged rappel"", with simple acoustics and basic amplification.  A million thanks to our friends for hosting us ! We just loved it. Avec quelques 20 000 personnes présentes, Mumford nous a gâté. Un spectacle haut en couleur, une acoustique bien équilibrée, un son et lumière époustouflant ! ",
Mumford & Sons,"My gosh this was spectacular!  Best show I've ever seen.  Lord Huron opened, and they were great and are one of my favorite bands.  That was too short (only 30 minutes), but otherwise lovely.  But Mumford & Sons really put on a show.  The set list was a great mix of old and new favorites and they are so high energy.  The encore had 5 or 6 songs, including an amazing cover of Hurt.  And ending with Delta was just icing on the cake.  It was a very memorable night!  I feel so lucky that I got to go. ",
Mumford & Sons,"My 7th M&S show.  The guys are certainly consistent in the quality of show they produce!  It's interesting to experience a band in different cities.  Marcus was way more well behaved in Alabama than he is in California, which amused me.  The songs from Wilder Mind are much better live and it is always great to hear their previous songs.  It was my nephew's first concert so this one was definitely highly anticipated and we were definitely not dissapointed! Har! ",
Mumford & Sons,What a fantastic show! The band were so full of energy and passion and it really shone out from the stage. Great staging (and incredible)lighting that made the gig completely inclusive and made the audience feel very much a part of everything. Marcus Mumford's voice sounded incredible for such a huge venue and the changes between microphones and areas of the stage were seamless. Would definitely recommend and can't wait for the next live performance. ,
Mumford & Sons,"Great concert, although I had some issues regarding the scene stage. A 360 scene makes it hard to have a 100% feeling. To see the backside of the Singer....mmm, have my doubts. Also the sound set up makes it challenging to get the Right feeling as the sound came from above and backwards.... Well, challenging set up! But the performance and the audience made it all into a full succes story!! Thx Guys for a marvelous evening? Best Walle ",
Muse,"Enjoyed the band but not the show. The organizers failed in everything they could fail. Believe me, I've been to a lot of international shows here in Argentina and Chile, and this was the first time ever that I couldn't hear the music some times. The ""Complejo al Río"" is in a great zone of Vicente López, really near to buses, subway, and two of the most important avenues (Av. Santa Fe/Cabildo/Maipú and Av. Libertador); so I got there without any troubles and even had some food because there were a lot of places to eat or drink near it. It all went down when the showtime was getting near: I got in without getting checked, as most people, really dangerous; then, the entrance was full of construction debris (dangerous x2). Once I was in, I realized that the venue was pretty much a cement parking lot with a couple of bleachers, wouldn't be much of a problem if it weren't that: a) there were holes in the floor, so somebody could have get hurt while jumping and; b) it was on downhill, so that meant that in certain areas of the ""campo trasero"" you couldn't see anything. When it started, everyone was excited, jumping, but two songs in we realised that we couldn't hear sometimes: the sound came and then go away. You could literally heard people talking over the music! And this wasn't an acoustic show! The low-volume stayed the whole gig, and it ruined songs like Madness that I could literally not hear. Bonus track: Matt confused Argentina with Uruguay and used their flag here. Everyone shouting ""NOOO"" which meant hearing even less. Going strictly to the show: the band pulled out a pretty good one, they didn't interacted with the public a lot but considering videos I've seen, that's just how they are. The setlist was the very same of two days ago in Chile, so there's nothing to complain about though we Argentinians are used to the fact that the bands always play more songs here, or change the setlist a bit. Muse was not the case. I still had a great time and would totally go to see this band again, specially because I feel like I didn't got the full experience. It's too much to know that they never come with the full stages and theatrics to add the fact that they came without speakers. ",
Muse,"This was the 3rd concert I have seen Muse at.  I have to say as far as concerts go, you won't find one with any more to it than a Muse concert.  I have been to many concerts and I love them all.  Music made in a studio is never going to capture the real live sound.  Music is made to be played live! The Simulation tour was simply amazing.  Visually, audibly and just being there.  Having trombones being played, actually played not recorded and being a part of the opening was simply astonishing.  It as a great sound and visually it was amazing.  The same with Pressure, having the trombones out there added to the song and made it unbelievable. They also played Dig Down the acoustic gospel version live.  With Dom, Matt and Chris playing center of the stadium.  Chris on the acoustic guitar, Matt on the piano and Dom obviously on the drums.  What a neat set to see them playing so close together and the gospel signers on stage lit up by their costumes.  Very well done! Our son didn't(teenager) didn't understand the Close Encounters of the 3rd kind part.  Where Matt was playing the guitar and the mother ship was responding.  He is too young.  :-)  My wife and I got it. Watching Matt play his guitar by his tong!  What?  I had never seen anything like it.  He is amazing.  Chris is just amazing on bass and Dom on drums.  These guys can do it all! What a fun show.  I really appreciate what Muse has done to give back to their fan's.  Too many bands don't care as long as they sell their tickets.  Muse doesn't appear to be like that.  Even purchasing tickets, they allow the true fans to purchase first getting the best seats. I look forward to seeing them again!  Great show, great music, and a great time.  Playing for almost 2 hours.  Great job Muse! ",
Muse,"Over the course of two decades, Muse’s live show has evolved into one of the most sensational spectacles in the world - an experience worthy of four (!) live DVDs churned out since the release of Hullabaloo in 2001. From humble beginnings touring the UK dive bar circuit, the band’s intellectual prog-rock quickly earned them the heavy burden of ‘the next Radiohead’: a stigma brushed aside, and a prophecy fulfilled. The band’s trajectory to international stardom was driven in the early noughties by huge success around ‘Origin Of Symmetry’ and ‘Absolution’; a pair of records that delivered sold out arena shows across the globe. From that point on, Muse poured everything into their live show. From huge satellite dishes beaming light into the sky to monumental, rotating pillars, each tour delivers something totally unexpected, and utterly jawdropping. And that’s prior to any mention of the crazy, crazy talent exhibited on stage. Matt Bellamy, one of the few true rockstars of the modern age, thrashes and strokes at his guitar in equal measure, and delivers stunning falsetto vocals. Though the band have recruited extra, ‘behind-the-scenes’ members over recent years, the amount of noise produced by the three piece remains astounding. With Glastonbury and Coachella headline slots - and just about everything other accolade - under their belts, where now for Muse? Somehow, the only way, still, is up. And it’s guaranteed to be totally bombastic. ",
Muse,"Since their incarnation in 1994, the Devon trio has evolved from a garage rock band into a momentous live act that has conquered the largest stages and festivals all around the planet with their space-themed apoco-pop rock. The band has six albums in its discography, which was not seem like very much for an artist that has reached a reputation as saintly as Muse, yet it is what Matt Bellamy and co transform their music into onstage which continues to wow audiences. As the bass rumbles and begins 'Supremacy', the band appear all at once surrounded by fire and pyrotechnics as they wage some solar war all within their own minds. As they run through their hits such as 'Supermassive Black Hole' and 'Starlight' at blistering speeds, the audience have no choice to watch on in blind amazement. Matt Bellamy is a frontman often likened to the late, great Freddie Mercury and after seeing him perform you realise there is serious weight behind these lofty claims. No matter how big his crowd, Matt throws himself into every blistering guitar solo and whips crowds into frenzies like no other. When the finale of 'Knights Of Cydonia' kicks in, the audience has completely surrendered itself to the supernatural, surreal world of Muse and simply hope they will never return. ",
Muse,"Santiago de Chile - October 13th The first good surprise was with the opening band, Kaiser Chiefs. The show was short but a very good one! The singer, Ricky Wilson, is very charismatic and an excellent dancer! About Muse - Tour Simulation Theory: the sound was very good, the instruments were heard in good frequency and also the voices. The band has a strong connection on stage and a great dynamic between them. The setlist was very well chosen, mixing successful songs from previous albums, like Hysteria, Supermassive and Starlight; and new album hits like: Algorithm, Propaganda and Thought Contagion. The songs were similar to other shows that they played on this tour in all Latin America, but they surprised Santiago with the song Bliss (not in other setlists). Lead singer Matt sings very well live can make different tones of voice, is incredible, just like the albums! In addition, the lighting games and dancers who were on the stage during the show further contributed to the whole presentation. The show finished with Knights of Cydonia and made everyone very happy! A great night! Thank you Muse! ",
Muse,"I had seen Muse a few times at various festivals over the years (Reading twice, V Festival, Download) and wanted to see them in their own show and I thought what better place than to do that than at Londons O2 Arena. Muse played for 2 hours with a faultless performance. Belting out classics such as Plug In Baby, Stockholm Syndrome and completing the evening with the infectious Knights Of Cydonia as well as promoting songs from the current Drones album. My only regret of the evening was having to be upstairs on Level 4 for this concert. People standing in the Floor areas and Level 1 seem to be able to let loose and enjoy themselves but upstairs really didn't know how to behave at a rock concert with he majority remaining seated and I was even asked to sit down by the person behind me. Unfortunately the big arenas can bring out the punters who aren't used to what a rock concert can be about but i'll balance this comment by saying that I should have been downstairs if I really wanted to rock out. Great performance by band, disappointed with the crowd as a whole. ",
Muse,"We came in from Houston to see Muse in Austin.  I've had to miss their TX shows in the past because I didnt have the money or time, but this year I said fuck it, I'm going to this show and I wont miss them again.  It was so worth it.  They sounded amazing, the whole band are great performers.  They posted the whole concert on facebook so I thought that was cool.  I can watch it again if I want.  So, so worth it.  The stage was really cool with these stacks of video monitors in the back and they were staggered.  It's hard to describe, but it looked really good.  The only complaint I had was that I bought an actual seat but everyone stood the whole time, so it was kind of pointless, but I'm glad I had something to lean on if I got too tired.  It was kind of hard to see the band on stage because people were in the way, but I'm sort of short so...oh well.  It was a very minor complaint and nothing against Muse.  If (I should say WHEN) I see them again, I'll try to get a seat on the rail with no one in front of me, but you know how it goes. ",
Muse,"An impressive start with ""Psycho"" brought all the energy to the Olympia-halle without any warming up. The setlist was loaded with the tracks of their latest Best-Rock-Album-Grammy winner, ""Drones"", but also included some classics as ""Plug In Baby"", ""Stockholm Syndrome"", and an amazing performance of ""Citizen Erased"", a song from ""Origin of Symmetry"" rarely played in the latest years shows. The stage in itself deserves recognition as it was meant to rotate, while holding a structure from where around ten drones came into the show flashing and wandering around some meters over the crowd. In addition, a series of interactive projections were prepared in accordance to every song lyrics. Bellamy asked people to help on singing the already classic ""Time Is Running Out"", as well as ""Starlight"" and the whole chorus for ""Uprising"". A great show that clarifies why they are one of the best live bands at the moment. ",
Muse,"There is a reason these guys play in big arenas. It’s not just a few guys on a stage playing their music, it’s a production. Even up in the nosebleeds it was a great show. Spoiler alert! Don’t read any further if you don’t want to know. Had it all!  Glowing glasses, lit up suits, giant robots, a piano that shoots lasers, dancers with flashlights, smoke machines and glowing batons, and a special appearance by Eddie!  People hanging from wires, surprises coming up from trap doors, lasers, lasers and more lasers!  The set was a blistering 26 songs lasting a little over two hours! I will definitely see them again the next time they come to town.  Though not from the balcony.  They say “Don’t look down if you have a thing about heights.”  That’s where the stage is! Great show. ",
Muse,"Saw them in Milan 20/5. I've been attending concerts for more than 10 years now and this gig goes into my top 5!! The show, the energy, the sound (!!) was amazing! I was blown away by Matt's voice, so clear and beautiful, Chris's dexterity with the bass (for me the second best bass player ever) and Dominic's drum solos. I loved the round stage in the center of the arena, you can really see them well from wherever you are standing/seating. I really wish more bands could afford this kind of technology, oh well... And the video projections, especially the puppeteering part during The Handler... genious and scary! The setlist included almost all the songs I wanted to hear live (I only missed Stockholm Syndrome and Bliss). All in all, kudos to the guys, really, I hope too see them again very soon. ",
Muse,"Muse. What a show. Both a visual and aural feast of the senses... That Muse, namely Bellemy, but backed up so strongly, were musical was certainly not in question, but this gig has to be reviewed as the complete package. All the bells and whistles and then some, lighting, see through screens, drones, confetti, and a weird flying ship type thing were all present & accounted for. And all in the round too so everyone's view was brilliant. But of course, all that drama means nothing unless you have the songs to back it up, and boy do they have them, and a band to play them with power & agility. From pure rock to classical interludes to mad spaghetti western soundscapes to sing along anthems of defiance... A wonderful mad 2hour kaleidoscope not to be missed... ",
Muse,"I had seen Muse during their 2010 tour and knew they were good, but this concert was even better! Their latest album is entitled ""Drones"" and they cleverly used drones in their concert, first as large white globes that opened the first song, then later when a plastic bomber came out and swept over the stadium. Bellamy's voice, guitar work, and piano playing were stellar, exciting and strong! The drummer and base player really rocked their most popular songs from prior albums as well as the songs from the current album (about 3/4's). The video effects and light show was mind blowing!!! I cannot believe half of what I saw, nor can I imagine how they did it. I am even more of a fan now than I was prior to walking in to the concert. This is a MUST see show! ",
Muse,"I saw Oct 2 show, after seeing this tour in April in NYC. They had an opening band this time, which sucked, and we waited about 45 mins for Muse to come on after that act. Which isn't awful if you hadn't arrived as early as 3pm to the arena, like me! The show was great as usual BUT Foro Sol is a horrible venue for a Muse show. The catwalk is too small for anyone in Section B to get a good view, and the stage is quite small , so ANYONE  SEATED are too far to see anything! No matter how ""close to the stage"" the seats are. Also the tiny open water bottles they sell ARE A JOKE, and easily spill. Also this venue is enormous so getting to the metro on foot could take FOREVER unless you leave before any encores occur! Walk FAST ",
Muse,"This is my third time seeing a Muse performance and I swear, each time gets better!!! The energy, the sound, the visual effects.... it just blows your mind. Muse takes you to another level, keeps your in extreme excitement and makes you wanting to see more,even after you are exhausted of jumping, singing out loud and screaming, it's a nonstop. They also bring back memories of their past with teasers of tracks from Showbiz, Absolution, Origin of Symmetry, in fact, no album left behind. The all time favorites won't be missed: Madness, super massive black hole, the legendary Hysteria, which literary put me hysterical, just to mention a few. Bottom line: Seeing Muse live is a must. Worth it by any means possible. ",
Muse,"For anyone desiring to witness pure unadulterated musical genius, I highly suggest you witness Muse live at least once in your life. Separate the immaculate stage production that could rival Hollywood's finest display, and you still are left with magical brilliance that transcends time and space only in a fashion that Muse could accomplish. Bellamy's vocals are flawless, and his guitar riffs leave you breathless. Howard dominates the drums as if he is saving the world with every beat, and Chris' bass mastery is unmistakable and beyond comparison. The trio is sure to transport you to another dimension, the entire experience leaves you satisfied but craving more, more, more. ",
Muse,"WOW! These guys are touring 8+ months straight!! So much respect! Glad the world caught on the fragile and powerful voice of Matt, the smooth bass linesm the spectacularly intricate guitars, and the INSANE drums of MUSE!!! I been on since buying Absolution Album (yeah CD) in 2005! (Their best to date) I won tickets for a show JUST before my 21 or 22 bday... Many years ago. I have seen over 300 bands live, they are still one of THE BEST performances (visually AND sonically), it it holds one of my fav concert experiences of all time. You are TRANSPORTED to another state of conscious at a Muse show. DO NOT DENY YOURSELF THIS EXPERIENCE AT LEAST ONCE!!!!!!!!!!! ",
Muse,"I managed to get a ticket for the Muse gig at Glasgow's Barrowland Ballroom. It's a very intimate venue compared to the arenas that they are capable of selling out. I knew it was going to be scaled down to suit the venue, but even still the lighting they had to go with their set was fantastic. Then there was the music, which was absolutely brilliant. They definitely impressed me as a live act and backed up everything I'd heard about the quality of their shows. There is good crowd interaction in between songs as well which is good to keep the crowd bouncing. I will definitely be going to see them at a larger venue next time I get a chance. ",
Muse,"The recipe for the best concert of the year? Just bring the best band of the moment to Chile. The mix of the sound and the crowd reaction to every song was amazing. From ""Drill Sergeant"" to ""Knights of Cydonia"", every note was yelled and sang by us, the fans. Focusing on the music, the fact that the band is able to play in the exact same way that on the records, and show the same emotions that we were used to only see on the DVD's is pricelss. We went for something unique and that's what we got. The only thing I missed were a few songs, like Sing for Absolution and Bliss. But in the end it didn't matter. Nothing else mattered. ",
Muse,"AMAZING concert! It really feels like the entire arena turned into a live sci-fi movie - the effects are amazing, and so of course is the music. Needless to say, Matt and co are extremely competent musicians, and everything seems to have been rehearsed to near perfection. I enjoyed the fact that they not only played Drones songs, but also a lot of the old favorites. The only downsides were that 1. no encores; 2. not a lot of interaction with the crowd from the band. Overall, though, this is definitely one of the best concerts I've been to this year, and I would gleefully go again today if there were another one close by :) ",
Muse,"This was a truly wonderful concert and I'm so glad to have taken the effort to drive to Graz last evening to see and enjoy Muse at their best. If there was one unfulfilled wish it would have been some encores but every bit of the event was great with such inspiring music. If there was room for improvement it just concerns the management of the cloak rooms, that was a total disaster, everybody totally overwhelmed, iz took one hour to get our coats back and then another (!) to have my umbrella returned which I had been forced to hand-in in another location. Next time Muse comes to Austria please return to Vienna!! ",
Pitbull,"Went to see Pitbull in South Bend, Indiana. I’ve waited a long time to be able to see him perform and was so incredibly excited when my boyfriend surprised me with not only tickets but Center Stage Tickets and a fantastic date day and night out of town. We got there on time and the show started late. The opening performer was fantastic, then Yin Yang Twin (note not twins, because one failed to show up) was nowhere up to par. Now it was time for Mr. Worldwide to take the stage, excitement was a complete understatement of my feelings, ecstatic was more like it. Unfortunately, it wasn’t Pitbull to take the stage; but instead, the owner of the venue. He then announced that “due to weather in Florida, Pitbull couldn’t make it”, even following up with “we offered to send my private jet to pick him up”. Now we have to wait until the 24th to see if we need to receive a refund OR if it gets rescheduled. It doesn’t refund the pay we lost out on by taking the 2 days off work or the money we are out on our hotel room, dinner, or all the money we spent at the venue Sunday. My boyfriend was rather upset that this special day was closed with me crying for a while because of the pure disappointment of a ruined day for us. ",
Pitbull,"Armando Perez.....Mr. 305.......Mr. Worldwide......you know who I'm talking about, Pitbull. What's so good about him? EVERYTHING! His shows are the most energetic and fun concerts I've ever been too! It doesn’t matter where your seats are, you will have a good chance of getting a good shot of him! He doesn’t stay in one place, he works the entire stage. Expect a lot of dancing! He always looks like he’s having the time of his life when he’s doing a show! You can tell he loves his fans!! I've met some of the nicest people at Pitbull concerts, while waiting for the concert to start. His music just makes you happy and want to dance! Everything about his concert is good. It is such a positive atmosphere! The way he presents himself just makes you happy and puts you in a good mood. I will never forget the concert I went to on 6/9/2013, my birthday. It was the best birthday ever! I would definitely recommend a Pitbull concert, to everyone! If you like to have fun and dance, Come to a Pitbull concert. It is like a big party! You won’t regret coming! Dalé! ",
Pitbull,"Last night s Pibull concert makes him the only artist I've seen in person three times.  If he comes back on tour anywhere within a 12 hour drive-I'll see him a fourth time!   And I hope he does. The man is the ultimate show man and he never disappoints.  His concerts are electric from start to finish. His dancers, his musicians and the man himself make for lots to keep you entertained.  Those girls and their sexy costumes are the perfect on-stage accompaniment to the man the exudes sexy from his every pore.  That confidence, that swagger, that stage presence make for one heck of a fun show.  Pitbull knows how to throw a concert!!!!! The audience in Phoenix was right there with him every step of the way. There was singing, dancing, drinking and partying and a whole lot of fun being had by all. ",
Pitbull,"If you think you know Pitbull but have not seen him in concert you don't know what you are missing. A true showman he did not disappoint. My husband and I are originally from the Tampa Bay area but live in Tennessee now. We have been going to a number of shows lately and this one was on the bucket list. We traveled from TN to Fla for the Tampa concert and took my in-laws, both in their late 60's, and we all loved it. He weaves a story with the songs that is truly inspirational about a cuban from the streets that works hard and accomplishes the American dream. He is humble and has not forgotten his roots or that the fans are the reason he has his success. If you have a concert bucket list this artist should be on it. ",

Pitbull,It was sad we got there for a 7:30p show but it didnt begin til 8:10p then 30 min wait between then 1st & 2nd Act. Then after 2nd act we got told (at 10p)that Pitbull was not coming due to weather. The owner of Four Winds advised us that they offered to send a jet to go get him but it was declined. Now we wait til 6/24 to see when it is rescheduled and/or get a refund. We all should of been advised of this when we came in late at 6p not at 10p when all our money was already spent in concessions & apparel. Just very very disappointed!!! ,
Pitbull,"Awesome show!  Acoustics were great and my seats were excellent.  Had a really good time.  Loved his dancers and his tribute to other Latino artists.  Glad I was there.  wish he had sung other songs, but especially enjoyed ""It's going Down"".  Towards the end of the concert he blasted out confetti from a blaster over the audience.  That was a fun touch.  Fun!!!!!!! ",
Pitbull,"Songs were awesome.  He swore Alot.  Kept saying "" fucking this and fucking that ""    lots of women's bootie showing.  it was like I came to see thw videos of the women's bootie than pitbull concert. Ofcourse he's Mr worldwide.   Songs were great. Enrique  was amazing.  Hardly any videos and the one he played for Bailando was perfect. ",
Pitbull,"The concert was good but not as long or as exciting as previous rodeo concerts were. Still it was a good show. I'm sure seeing Pitbull in a stand alone 2hr concert would have a lot more songs and be more entertaining, the short rodeo concerts are still packed with lots of songs and are worth seeing for the price. ",
Pitbull,"Awesome performance. Amazing energy. The dancers were amazing too! One of the best concerts I've been to In a long time! His story is great and he was great at blending and connecting with the audience, which was a mixed crowd of ages and races. Everyone had a blast! So much fun! ",
Pitbull,"Great concert...wish I could have picked my sitting like other venus give you option to choose tbe section I was not certain where I was going to, hated my sitting but concert experience was great overall and parking as well as all the setup afterwards, very well organized!! ",
Pitbull,IT WAS AMAZING!!!!! Pitbull is such a phenomenal artist and entertainer. I couldn't have been more happy with it. I had a blast watching him and singing along. He is fantastic on stage. He really knows how to put on a great show. I love him and admire him so much. ,
Pitbull,It rained and rained and rained but Pitbull still put on an amazing show. He brings so much energy and fun to his live performances; so much that everybody danced and sang. The high point was when he sang Rain over me and we were all dancing in the rain. Fun! ,
Pitbull,"The concert was wonderful, really enjoyed his music. My seats sucked. But the concert was fun to see. He has a lot if energy & a fantastic smile, even from the nose bleeding seats it was great. Next time I'll get better sitting. ",
Pitbull,The show was cancelled. The show was cancelled. The show was cancelled. The show was cancelled. The show was cancelled. The show was cancelled. ,
Green Day,"My first experience with a Green Day concert was one of the greatest at Woodstock 99. That experience has stuck with me ever since then, as has my desire to see Green Day perform any time I get the chance. The first thing I can say about the Green Day concert experience is all about the crowd, as they are always a very rowdy, but very fun crowd! A bit crazy, a bit intoxicated, a bit of everything, and a whole lot of fun! By the time I actually get into the stadium and am waiting for the show to start, I already feel that I've had greatest time already and just can't wait for the insanity to kick in. For me personally, if Im not down in the middle of it all, in the pit, being able to jump around, crowd surf, exert some energy and really feel the music, it just wouldn't be a Green Day show. Their stage presence is intense and Billie Joe Armstrong really draws the insanity out of the crowd, encouraging the mosh, encouraging all-out fun. He runs around all over stage, having as much fun performing as the crowd is watching them. It's truly a sight to see and a show that I have always been excited to go to and look forward to every time. The sound and light show can be overpowering at times, but that is mostly a good thing, as it just fuels the crowd and creates even more energy and excitement. By the end of the show, it's obvious that everyone has had so much fun, is tired and sweaty, while at the same time still bubbling over with energy and excitement. It is indeed an experience to be had, and if you are a Green Day fan at all, then you deserve to have this experience at least once!! ",
Green Day,"The concert was really great! The Support act played at 7 pm to 7.30 pm. Half an hour later, green day started to Play. They Played for 2 and a half hours. The First Song they played was Bang Bang. They played a Lot of Songs (New and older ones). While they played ""revolution radio"", they had pyro, like big flames. They also had exploding things, where flames,lights and loud noises came. This was definitely great. They also had on the end a vergessen big amount of confetti comming down. While they were on stage , they let 3 people on stage. 2 were allowed to sing with them and one could Play the gituare with them. Billie said at the end, that the girl playing the gituare could keep it. Another cool thing was, that they had water ""guns"". I was in the second row and billie really got me and all the other people near me wet. In between the concert they also played Songs like ""Hey Jude"" by the beatles. At the end they played 3 last Songs: American Idiot; Jesus of suburbia; ordinary World. They whole concert was really great and I would say it was the best concert I've ever been to. ",
Green Day,"Unless you want to be an American Idiot, I would thoroughly recommend going to see the incredible rock legends that are Green Day, perform live. The alternative rock band have been making waves recently by taking the stage at a number of high profile festivals. Each time the band make their way on to another festival stage, always as headliners (obviously), the crowd go absolutely wild. Green Day always produce a crazy crowd, they wouldn’t be indie rock legends if they didn’t, and the crowds they muster up are always undoubtedly fun. Green Day have a number of hits, from iconic classics such as ‘American Idiot’ to slower tunes such as ‘Boulevard of Broken Dreams’ . And they played them all. The energy and passion that the band brought on to stage was phenomenal, with Billie Joe Armstrong drawing out the crowd’s madness and encouraging each and every mosh pit that the music hungry crowd were all too excited to form. Armstrong’s vocals were on point and the band proved themselves to be the talented musicians we all remembered them to be. ",
Green Day,"One of the worst kept secrets of recent festival years was the spiritual return to Reading Festival by the almighty punk rock band Green Day. The 'American Idiot' hitmakers had been rumoured to be taking to the NME stage from the offset of the event and as promised they arrive at 12pm on Saturday to perform to a packed out field as the majority of the site flocks towards the big top. Playing four tracks from the iconic 'Dookie' this really was a great show that could have headlined the main stage with ease. As opposed to other 'surprise' artists who come and play acoustic sets of their B sides from 1992 to 1995, Green Day were here to enthuse the crowds and delight with the hits. Whether you were inside or outside of the tent, everybody sang along at deafening volumes to 'Know Your Enemy' and 'American Idiot' as the band charged around the stage and into the lucky front row. It may not have been a well guarded secret but something makes me think Billie Joe Armstrong and co wanted the biggest crowd available and damn they got it. ",
Green Day,"Green Day is the type of band that makes you either want to go overthrow the government or go find the love of your life and everything in-between. Every song has its own unique story that touches the hearts of everyone in the audience. Despite all the hatred and fear and walls that divide us in this country right now, Green Day allowed for a brief moment of tranquility and release of political tension that I think everyone needs right now. You can just forget about your problems for a while and live in the moment. The lyrics are so empowering and inspiring. Billie Joe makes everyone feel accepted. He provides a safe haven for the oddballs, weirdos, and those who don't ""fit in"". You can be whatever you want, love whomever you want, and just be yourself and have fun and not feel judged. Mike Dirnt is a phenomenal bassist and Tré Cool is a complete badass on drums. Seeing them in concert was surreal. The ear ringing afterwards is totally worth it. If you get the chance to see Green Day in concert, do it. You won't regret it. ",
Green Day,"My first Green Day experiences date back to high school, I was 15-16 and it was like ‘93-‘94 before Dookie even came to be. I would see this punk band from the Bay Area perform in some local pizza place in Bakersfield, California called Jerry’s Pizza.  From then on I was in love. Like IN LOVE! I loved the bands music! Their sound was something that just got me and to this day Who Wrote Holden Caulfield? is my most favorite Green Day song still. I take a lot of pride in saying I was part of the small percentage of people who loved their music before the entire world knew who they were. They are badass, Hands down! AND I’m thankful BJ had a sweet wife and family to help him when he needed it most and that he is still breathing and that he is here to give us more music with his fellow brothers of the band. ",
Green Day,"Back in 1994, I wouldn't have dreamed that Green Day would one day become a rock and roll institution, displaying an energy and repertoire that kept the multi-generational crowd on its feet for nearly 3 hours. Complete with impressive pyrotechnics and a well-polished knack for inviting fans onto stage, these guys put on an impressive show. Though the show at times teetered on getting bogged down in call and response, my 12 year old son left the venue as hyped up about Green Day as my 45 year old self recollects my 19 year old self having been. Since those good old days, the guys of Green Day have gone from thrashing a few chords to reveling in surprisingly complex musicianship. I'd gladly go again, and I appreciated Billy Joe and the boys for leaving it all onstage. ",
Green Day,"I went to Green Day concert in Mannheim at 18th of January and I feel the need to write this as a duty! I've been a true concert girl in my whole life, traveled the world for the love of music; I've been to stadiums to see the superstars as well as dark bars to listen to not much known quality music. I listen to from heavy metal to jazz and classics. And I've never seen a concert so interactive and energetic in my experiences! Now I'm full of light and joy! Light gives the hope to fight the dark, joy in my heart sends away the devils in my tired mind! After a long tiring period, I feel ALIVE again! Whatever happens in this crazy world in these evil times, I'm happy and I enjoy it. Thank you Green Day. Let there be light, let there be music in our souls! ",
Green Day,"This was my first concert in the Pit, and it was the best night of my life. I got really hyped when I saw how close I was to the stage, and I met some pretty cool people there. When Green Day came out, I actually started crying. I was standing only a couple feet away from the band at points, and I know it was a night I'm never going to forget. I think what made Green Day different that most concerts was how they called so many people on stage and gave away so much stuff. Some people got to go on stage and sing lyrics, or play guitar, and actually got to meet the band members and I honestly thought it was so amazing because they made someone else have the best night of their life. This concert was hands down 10/10, in fact, it broke the scale. ",
Green Day,"It's been 9 years since Green Day made an appearance in Northern Ireland. Boy did they make up for it Rancid, Green Day's tour buddies. Started the show off with high adrenaline. So much so that a mosh pit itself began to form at the front of the stage. I was slap bang in the middle of it. This high adrenaline show meant that when Green Day started the crowd was already pumped and ready. And they delivered on the he action packed, high octane poreformance everyone wanted. I would easily call this the best night of my life without question. It was a phemomonal performance from both Green Day and Rancid and I wold seriously recommended that,if they're coming to somewhere near you. You get tickets ASAP. ",
Green Day,"Spectacular exibition! A lot of special effects and good balance between old and new songs. I am not good at enphasizing good things because this was really huge belive me! But I am more able to write what wasn't that perfect: The only thing that was missing in the concert itself is ""wake me up when september ends"".  It is a quite important pice and I am very surprised that we haven't had the chance to hear it. I have also to say that they should have more ""most wanted"" t-shirt available at the merchandise since they were all sold out and not only couldn't get a t-shirt!  But thanks Green Day you are amazing! ",
Green Day,"Saw Green Day during the Canadian part of their RevRad tour. They're my lifelong favourite band and this was my first time seeing them in concert. It was so incredible that it felt surreal. They played a few songs off their new album and a ton of classics, all the way back to their first album (39/Smooth). The energy was electric, illuminated by spectacular lights, graphics, and pyrotechnics. Every single member is unbelievably talented and they sound amazing live. There's a reason that so many modern bands cite Green Day as an inspiration. Phenomenal performers, 100/10, am planning to go again in a few months. ",
Green Day,"These guys are amazing!!! I've listened to them since their Dookie days and was rapt my son wanted to go with me.  I'm glad I've finally got to see them and they were better than I could have imagined. The sound and the energy from Greenday crackled and went straight through you, the effects were awesome and their generosity was outstanding in getting a couple of the audience up to sing and play guitar - then gifting the overwhelmed young guy the guitar!!!! Billie Jo, Mike, Tre and their entire team put together an epic show to the enjoyment of all of us who were there.  Thanks for a great time guys! ",
Green Day,It was the best day of my life. Honestly they are my favorite band so I was already expecting something good but it was even better than I dreamed. There was one moment where I got up on my dad's shoulders for the song Still Breathing and I was close to the stage and I made direct eye contact with Billie Joe Armstrong. It was amazing. It was a dream.come true. To see all of my favorite songs live and in person is amazing. I also got to be less than ten feet away from my heroes so that was also a plus. Green Day had so much energy and put on a great show. It was and always will be the best day of my life. ,
Green Day,green day was a great show but for me the takeaway was the support act. the interrupters were awesome and i would love to hear more of them. thankfully green day played a mix of old and new which kept a crowd of old fans happy. the venue let us down a little. the entry was a shambles with the half baked metal detector setup and terrible transport to the venue. overpriced food and bevvies were expected but they managed to be even more expensive than a sports stadium yet with slower service. foe a venue of this size they really need to think about a better way to enable sizing of clothes. ,
Green Day,"Bom, vou escrever em português porquê o inglês ainda não é o meu forte.. Foi o primeiro show do Green Day em que fui, e confesso que fiquei mais admirado pela banda do que era antes, conheci novas músicas, e etc. O único ponto negativo que eu tenho a declarar é que não tocaram minha música preferida, e não só a minha, como a de muitos outros fãs também, a música 'Wake me up when september ends', uma das primeiras que conheci da banda, e que escuto até os dias de hoje. Fora isso, aproveitei e gostei muito do show, vou guardar recordações eternas. Thank you. :) ",
Green Day,"Hello folks from Songkick, all right? First of all I would like to say that this is my first review and that at the moment I use Spotify to listen to all my favorite songs from Green Day. Well, the show I witnessed on November 3, 2017 was simply surreal. I never imagined going to a big show. It was really amazing. Oh really. I'm so puzzled so far about what Billie Joe's troupe did in São Paulo, Brazil. I wanted to recommend everyone to attend a concert of this new tour, from Revolution Radio. You're really good. I loved everything. Thanks and hugs personally. Thanks! ",
Green Day,"Green Day at Wrigley field was one of the best live shows that I've ever attended. The stage was set up in the center field area. There were Green Day flags on the scoreboard which was a cool addition. They came on just a bit after 8pm, the set list included many of the bands older songs with a good mix of their newer tunes. It really showed how much they enjoy playing, some bands just go though the motions, but not here. There were some fireworks and pyrotechnics as well as a confetti cannon. I'd recommend seeing Green Day live, it was an unforgettable experience. ",
Green Day,"I can't believe that it took me so long to see Green Day live! After all of these years, these guys still know how to put on a Rock show. They were bringing people up on stage to help them sing and even had an 8 year old boy come up and play guitar for a bit, then gave him the guitar afterwards. It was amazing and surreal all at the same time. They played a nice mixture of new songs and old classics which also made it great! These guys will be at the top of my list to see again the next time they come through. ",
Green Day,"The show was absolutely amazing to say the least, it went way past my expectations I loved every minute of it but I have to say the most memorable moment would have to be when they started the show Tré Cool (the drummer) came out dancing in a pink bunny costume!!, there interaction with the crowd was amazing and made everyone feel welcome, they invited 3 people up on the stage to sing and one played guitar which was given to her by Billie Joe Over all I had a great experience and would love to see them again ",
Arctic Monkeys,"Seeing Arctic Monkeys not once, but twice, in two days was absolutely insane - I'd like to have rated it a Four out of Five simply for the pun but personally I think there's no doubt that the show(s) were as close to perfect as a concert can get.  Mini Mansions were quite a decent support act - their set included a few fillers but ended on a high with an energetic rendition of Mirror Mountain. AM's setlist varied over the two nights but both nights were an amalgamation of songs from all six albums - a perfect blend of atmospheric, new TBHC songs and older, grungier hits. Live staples like Brianstorm, Pretty Visitors and Don't Sit Down Cause I've Moved Your Chair had everyone out of their seat, while there were also some (pleasantly) surprising inclusions like Library Pictures and From The Ritz To The Rubble (first time in Australia since 2009!!!). Both nights' encores concluded with a blistering performance of R U Mine? which was the perfect way to end such a intense night. Alex Turner's onstage antics oozed pure class combined with true rock n' roll - a highlight of the second night was the dance Alex did whilst holding a stool above his head! The crowd went crazy for that - as well as his famous hip gyrations, especially during Cornerstone! Matt was full of energy on the drums, Jamie and Nick were equally hyped - but nothing really compared to Alex's voice, both speaking and singing (which quite frankly I could listen to all day). The sound quality was utterly fantastic - you could not ask for more from a band - the only minor downside was the minimalistic, Kubrick-esque backdrop & stage - but Arctic Monkeys have never really been the type of band that relies on on-stage effects to transfix the audience… Alex does that quite adequately on his own! As a group of sixteen-seventeen year olds, myself and my friends were probably the youngest people there but it was refreshing to see a lot of people our age - the majority was (understandably) uni students. Such an outstanding pair of performances that I'm so glad I went twice (and to be honest it was so enthralling I genuinely could have gone a third time if there was another Melbourne show). Alex Turner is, in his own words, a CERTIFIED MINDBLOWER. A definite Five out of Five. ",
Arctic Monkeys,"This was by far the best concert I have ever been to. Everyone on the crowd was just so wild, happy and full of energy. The whole crowd sang all of the songs and danced to it. That energy that I felt when I was there face to face with the Arctic Monkeys was incredible, I can’t even begin to explain it. I wish I could go back in time and rewatch that concert. I just love them, and their songs are extremely good. Alex’s voice was perfect last night. Jamie, Nick and Matt were amazing too. The arena where the show took place was pretty good and had a nice space. It was a little crowded in the beginning, but then people just started to spread out. The moment when 505 came on, everyone just danced calmly and sang along so well. We all turned on our cellphones flashlights so we could light it up. Do I Wanna Know was my favorite song performed from last night. I love that beat and it’s my favorite song in the whole world. I wish I could listen to it played live everyday. Honestly, going to the Arctic Monkeys concert was the best decision I have ever made in my life. I wish everyone could be there to feel the vibe with me. I also managed to buy myself a shirt, not from the official store because it was expensive, but from someone else selling them. It looks really good, it’s from the “Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino” album. I just wish they would’ve played some other songs too, like “I Wanna Be Yours”, “Mardy Bum”, “No Buses”, “Despair in the Departure Lounges” and a couple others. Alex sang pretty fast and wouldn’t give us a minute between each song, and unfortunately that resulted on the show going on by pretty quickly. But despite it all, I loved it and it was the best night of my life so far. It was perfect, I miss it already. Jamie, Nick, Alex and Matt, you guys are amazing. Thank you for everything last night. I will never forget it. ",
Arctic Monkeys,"I'm a fan. I must start it off saying this, 'cause as a fan, they have never, ever let me down.  I've been to three Arctic Monkeys live gigs, in different phases of the band. The first one, back in 2007 when we were all just kids wanting to have a blast, than in 2011 and finally last Friday, in front of a sold out 35 thousand people crowd. My favorite will always be the first one... I was young, reckless and hopeful because of this great band that had started online and was actually very good. But to see them all grown up and mature, and with complete control of that sea of people that was there just for them, was very, very meaningful.    They interact less with the crowd than before, and have more of a rockstar attitude, but it suits them. It's all part of the show and it doesn't make them less charismatic at all. Specially Mr. Alex Turner.    The setlist is a real trip through their career so far and even thought they had to cut a few fan favorites, the most meaningful songs are there, shining and evoking beautiful sing-a-longs. One of the highlights ended up being an acoustic rendition of ""Mardy Bum"", right before the last song, very effusively requested by the fans and beautifully delivered by Alex Turner, all by himself. Whenever he was not playing guitar and singing with his eyes closed, he would leave the guitar, hold the mic with two hands and dance like no one even knew he could. Oh, Mr. Turner... You've become quite the frontman!      One of the most interesting things about them is that you'll get the same thrill by watching a large arena set and a small, intimate performance. Their songs are just that powerful. And these guys aren't even in their 30's yet! Long live to the Arctic Monkeys! ",
Arctic Monkeys,"Arctic Monkeys, making me as giddy as a goat since 2002! Need I say anymore? Some would say they have done the full 360 in their last 5 albums, but they still somehow manage to create something different and even more meaningful each time a new release comes along, which is what you want from a mainstream band. As they have had to grow up as well as lock down their career in a relatively short period of time, their sounds represent a different stage in their lives from overnight success, heartache and self discovery. After hiding away in the desert to record an epic follow up album to 'Suck it and see' (Admirable contribution from Josh Homme) the sheer dedication to their music was sincerely portrayed in 'AM' and things got really serious over night. After a test drive of the new material at Glastonbury 2013, a few new hairstyles and a nonchalant attitude the band became pure rock and roll stars. From small venues to outdoor arenas Arctic Monkeys can do no wrong - With carefully selected playlists to cover their early and playful classics such as 'I bet you look good on the dance floor' and 'Dancing shoes' right through to their seductive, jaw dropping, riff-tastic songs 'My propeller' and 'Don't sit down cause I moved your chair'. Frontman 'Sir' Alex Turner knows how to work a crowd with a bit of cheeky banter and endless appreciation to their fans, which is always an added bonus. With Arctic Monkeys, always expect the unexpected. ",
Arctic Monkeys,"Arctic Monkeys is the most riveting mainstream band you could see live. They feature music from their first release to their last, create a powerful atmosphere for fans, and Alex Turner interacts with the crowd in a refreshing way with his exotic accent. Arctic Monkeys' music varies from upbeat to slower tempo, but in my opinion all of it is amazing. They could potentially play any venue successfully due to their great stage presence and how similar their live music is to their recorded music. I was astounded by their true talent, which is hard to find in mainstream music today with the excessive use of autotune and other enhancement programs. My favourite part of the concert was when they played ""I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor"" because it was a song that the majority of concert attendees knew and the vibe completely changed when they played the song. It brought new and old fans together and excited the audience. The most surprising thing was that I thought it wasn't going to be a very good concert due to the fact that I paid for last minute seats in the back, but honestly, it didn't affect the atmosphere at all! The concert was even better than most of the concerts I've been up close to in large venues. Overall, they played a great live show and it was one of the best concerts I've ever been to. I'd highly recommend buying tickets and experiencing some real musical talent and live playing. ",
Arctic Monkeys,"The whole experience was amazing. Although the Lemon Twigs were down a brother (With Brian having to go home due to being ill) it did not effect their electric performance, finishing the set with one of their best songs 'As Long As Were Together'. And then of course. The Arctic Monkeys came on and the crowd lost it before they'd even started playing. The set they played was a perfect balance between the new album and their older stuff and not a single person was sitting down by the last song. As they packed up and walked off the crowd (as is to be expected) started cheering for another song and as per usual Alex Turner does not disappoint! The boys came back on stage and bought the house down with 'I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor' and finally 'R U Mine'. A perfect night. ",
Arctic Monkeys,"Excellent! As always... People aren't crazy about the new album but ""Four out of Five"" has enough swagger to start the gig and even though they played 505 a bit too early for me the catalogue and band's attitude is far more than enough to keep even the most cynical (me) happy. That's where I draw the line. Forest Hills is an absolutely BEAUTIFUL venue and the weather was perfect but FLASH SEATS is a terrible experience. I had to transfer a ticket and we encountered issues that meant we missed the first few songs (you could hear 4/5 thankfully, but didn't see it). Flash Seats...either get your app in order or just let us print the tickets at home like every other normal working ticket app...we didn't need another one but you've cornered a market for yourself. Sort it out. ",
Arctic Monkeys,"Finally, my long awaited chance to see Arctic Monkeys. Live. In concert. How can that not make anyone crazy with joy? Needless to say, THEY ROCKED. True, finding somewhere comfortable to sit in the Klipsch Lawns that wasn't covered in mud or bird poop was hard and stressful, but it all disappeared the second the electrifying riff of ""Do I Wanna Know?"" broke on stage. After that, all that worried me was completely gone as I soon found myself every single second. And oh yeah, White Denim know how to kick some butt as well, as they somehow managed to make and awesome concert even more enjoyable. My only regret? That the concert couldn't go on forever. Visually Stunning, musically vivid, here's to you Alex Turner and your Arctic Monkeys, may your music always be more than awesome! ",
Arctic Monkeys,"I had an absolutely fantastic time seeing the Arctic Monkeys live, without a doubt.  Their set list was delivered very well; the concert started with a few fun songs, wound down to slow songs, and build back up again to more fun songs to end the night with. They upheld their reputation of talent on their instruments,  of course. These guys played in a way that made everyone in the crowd fell alive and on fire.  Seeing them at an outside venue was marvelous. It was open so you weren't going deaf, there was a little more space between each person, and the sound was able to get to everyone without being overwhelming.  The opener, White Denim, definitely impressed me.  The whole experience was unforgettable. I love them more after this concert! ",
Arctic Monkeys,"The Arctic Monkeys are amazing live. I was already in love with them just listening to their music on my phone. But live? Wow. Their lead singer, Alex Turner, has a lot of interesting and funny dance moves. For example, to the song ""Don't Sit Down Cause I've Moved Your Chair"" he acts out all the actions in the song. During the show, there were a lot of cool lights and everyone was having a good time. If you really need to read a review to decide whether or not you should go to the Arctic Monkeys concert, then you're not as in love with them as you should be in order to go to their concert. But since I've already written so much, I hope you divide to go because it is a truly unforgettable experience. ",
Arctic Monkeys,"Very disappointing. I'd waited for years to see the Arctic Monkeys and I was left very disappointed by their show.They had no connection with the audience, they played a series of songs, with lengthy gaps of silence in between each song. No song was lengthened with longer guitar or singing solo’s, it was short and sweet, no more effort was put in. They played about 5 songs from their latest album, which fell completely flat on the audience, any energy that was still there from the previous song / silence, went whilst Alex sang (to my mind), the new albums awful songs. On the way out, I heard a lot of people saying how disappointed they were too. I won’t be going to see them again ! ",
Arctic Monkeys,"Great show at Artpark in Lewiston, NY!!    As a fan since 2007 and having never seen the Arctic Monkeys live, I was more than excited for this show.  A hot night, which threatened rain didn't dampen my eagerness and the boys from Sheffield definitely did not disappoint.    Arctic Monkeys played most of the songs from their new album, 'AM', mixed with a few fan favorites/singles from previous albums, such as, 'Crying Lightning' and 'I Bet That You Look Good on the Dancefloor'.  The crowd was into the bands performance from the very beginning as Arctic Monkeys played a hard-hitting, heavy riff based set, with a few acoustic songs to help the crowd catch it's breath. ",
Arctic Monkeys,"I just found out about Arctic Monkeys this year because a friend suggested them to me. I listened to Arabella and I was hooked immediately. I later found out they were coming to my city, so obviously I HAD to go. At the time, I really didn't like their old stuff, but after going to that concert, I loved it all. They are AMAZING performers. I really loved how Alex Turner would just talk in between songs to the audience.  It was my first concert ever, and they didn't dissapoint. That Arctic Monkeys concert was the best night of my life by far. I only wish I could go back in time and relive that night. ",
Arctic Monkeys,"I swear Alex Turner and his hips will be the death of me!   Such an amazing gig though, the Monkeys create such an electric atmosphere, everyone was jumping around and singing their heads off.   There was a nice mixof old and new material, and they didn't hold back on the classics like ""I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor"".  The encore was superb; a nice bit of solo acoustic stuff from Alex thrown in which really mellowed the crowd out.   I enjoyed myself immensely and can't wait for them to return to Ireland in the future, I'll definitely be one of the first in line to buy a ticket! ",
Arctic Monkeys,"I've been to my fair share or concerts, and I can easily say Arctic Monkeys at Staples Center was the greatest concert I've ever been to. Even though our seats were as high up as you could get, we had the most amazing time and loved every second of it. We sang and danced our hearts out all night, and when they left the stage the crowd went wild for an encore. They did not disappoint, they came back out full throttle and just killed it with the best songs. They closed out with R U Mine and it was truly a magical moment. It was a perfect night and I would most definitely see them again. ",
Arctic Monkeys,"it was absolutely nuts. support was the lemon twigs (a bit kooky, but a good crowd warmer) and arctic monkeys came on at quarter to nine to an ecstatic audience. the show was insane, the set list was well organised and all the songs were placed with thought so that the whole concert flowed brilliantly. the atmosphere at the o2 was insane, clearly a lot of dedicated fans went to see the ,sold out, show on the first night. overall, an absolutely amazing concert, and a perfect mix of tranquility base hotel + casino with all six of the previous albums. ",
Arctic Monkeys,Brilliant from start to finish. The Lemon Twigs opened and were really good. I wasn’t familiar with them but they put on a great show and warmed up the crowd. The Arctic Monkeys came on with a great setlist of 21 songs. The stage was very “ Tranquility Base “ themed with awesome lights and stage sets. The band were as good as they have ever been. I haven’t seen them live before so it was a memorable experience. I hope I don’t have to wait as long until the next concert as it was amazing. I would go tonight again if I could. 5 out of 5 ! ,
Arctic Monkeys,The perfect blend of nostalgia and killer new tracks. With a set that made you wonder when the muzak would start and then everything kicked off into an amazing set of some of the best rock that you could ever hope to see performed with panache and style and a level of nonchalance. With surprises of the Ritz to the rubble and 505 to the obvious Do I want know and bet you look good on the dance floor.  The song choice was everything you could hope for and performed even better! Will always recommend seeing the Arctic Monkeys at any opportunity ,
Arctic Monkeys,"Though I like their first album and love 2011’s Suck It And See (every song brilliant), their new album Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino is coma-inducing and incredibly dull lounge music, so much so that many people at the concert used the new songs for a bathroom break or to get more drinks, and one woman fell fast asleep in front of us. I know they have to promote the new album, but I can’t forgive them for not playing Brick by Brick, such an iconic song used in Peaky Blinders. Our first disappointing show since coming to London. ",
Arctic Monkeys,"Epic!! Went to opening night with my daughters & we were debating on way there it we’d get all the new stuff or some of the classics. We got the best of both worlds - new stuff from Tranquility Base plus classics like Brianstorm & Dance Floor. Alex Turner is now an assured frontman, not hiding behind floppy hair any more. No inane chatter between songs just assured playing & singing. A brilliant night, would go again if I could. If you get the chance go, you won’t see better live music this year. ",
Jason Derulo,"Sitting on the beach gives me the chance to take in some breathtaking sights like a clear blue sky, crashing waves and Jason Derulo's abs! That's right. Jason Derulo performed some of his best songs live at the beach for the T4 concert. Thousands of fans loaded the beach to crowd around and see Jason Derulo dance and sing. Set in the background of the carnival pier, concertgoers were already in a great mood and ready to party. Giant beach balls bounced from fan to fan as everyone got sweaty along with Jason Derulo and his dance music. It seemed impossible to stop bouncing to the beat as he continued to rock the stage with heart-thumping music and sexy lyrics. Even in the middle of the day, the lighting for the concert was impressive. Bright, colored lights twirled around keeping beat to the music as if the entire stage was a visual equalizer. A team of dancers joined him on stage which included a long catwalk into the crowd. A true performer, Jason Derulo seemed tireless as he turned it up a notch with him and his dancers coming down the catwalk to smoke blowing out of the stage and fireworks. He was ready to show the entire crowd a great time and by all means he did not disappoint. ",
Jason Derulo,"Jason Joel Desrouleaux better known by his stage name Jason Derulo knows to turn a simple gig into a real show with a barrage of dancers, tight routines and an unimaginable amount of contemporary pop hits. Derulo can work his audience and as he appears to massive cheers, everyone in the venue knows they are in for a great night. Starting with one his earliest hits 'In Your Head' rings around the room and the audience dance and cheer enthusiastically. Derulo keeps the audience on their feet for the whole evening as he plays hit after hit including 'Ridin' Solo' and 'Whatcha Say'. He allows them respite during an acoustic performance of 'The Other Side' where he allows his vocal to take centre stage whilst charming the audience as a whole. The whole audience cheer wildly at the finale and Jason looks sincerely grateful. A winding up of 'Don't Wanna Go Home', 'The Other Side', 'Talk Dirty' and his latest track 'Trumpets' is really an all-out pop assault on the senses and keeps the audience cheering as the final confetti falls onto the crowd and Derulo takes his final bow knowing he has amazed this evening. ",
Jason Derulo,"I've been to many concerts before, but the Jason Derulo concert was beyond anything I've been to before. Not only is he an amazing singer live, he puts on an amazing show. Jason really performs beyond what other artists can do. His dancing and singing comes together along with the light show given. The way he is introduced onto the stage is also so spectacular and has to be seen yourself-no explanation. Most importantly, his personality shines through with many speeches given and dance moves obviously very fitting to himself. Dancers were fantastic! I am a huge fan of his music (a variety through genres all wrapping up into hip hop) but even if I wasnt, his show was a fun experience for anyone and I would recommend it to anyone looking for something fun to do. ",
Jason Derulo,"Die „Vorbands“ waren leider nicht so zufriedenstellend und die recht lange zeit bis derulo auf die bühne kam war dementsprechend anstrengend. Jedoch muss man sagen das Jason Derulo eine gute show abgeliefert hat. Die Tänze waren aufregend, die liedwahl sowohl für die alten sowie auch die neueren fans klasse und an vielen stellen bewies er das er nicht nur gut aussieht und tanzt sondern auch eine wahnsins stimme an den Tag legt. Coole show alles perfekt abgestimmt, viele Überraschungen. Fazit: Top konzert mit einem holprigen start ",
Jason Derulo,"I've been to many concerts, but I've never enjoyed it as much as I did in Jason Derulo. It was an incredible show and I would repeat it a thousand times more. If you have the opportunity, you should go, you will really love it for sure. He is a singer and an stunning dancer. He's dances will leave you amazed. He is so sexy!!! If I have the opportunity to repeat, I will do it without a doubt. LOVE YOU JASON. He and his show is AMAZING. ",
Jason Derulo,"Fantastic concert !! First time seeing Jason, dancing was high energy and entertaining every minute Was enjoyable ,totally loved how he connected with audience and his exit from the concert stage riding out on the horse was so cool , I attend the rodeo every year I live in Belize and I read Jason is from Miramar Florida I always visit family there, Go Jason !!! may your career soar . ",
Jason Derulo,"It was the best concert I have ever been to. Jason Derulo is an amazing performer and dancer, the mood and atmosphere was constantly full of energy. The songs all interlinked well with one another and it wasn't like there was a sudden stop and start after each song. Also the guests he had were very good, especially the DJ. ",
Jason Derulo,"It was an amazing concert, the support acts were great and it was brilliant over all. Jason was great with the audience and it was the best concert I’ve ever been to. I would definitely go to see him preform again. Mia Beggs x ",
Jason Derulo,"The concert was awesome, even though I was way at the back. Royal Arena would have been the best venue for the concert. I did not even see Jason, all I could hear was his voice. A venue with seats would have been better. ",
Jason Derulo,"Best show ever! Singing amazing, dancing AMAZING and show amazing. He is the best performer u can imagine! The lights and movies were so beautifull. High notes soooo good. You just gotta love him with his sexy moves. ",
Black Eyed Peas,"Black Eyed Peas puts on concerts like no other. Each member of the group is so different from one another, yet together, their performances are just awesome. They were THE hot act in the early 2000's, but they honestly haven't lost any of their charm. Fergie is sexy, but keeps it clean – her voice is nice and she really makes the group. As unique and crazy as Will I Am is, the sound is just not complete without Fergie. They go all out too: the stage setup is usually completely outrageous (but in a good way). There's sometimes so much going on to the point where its as if you're the one performing in some kind of huge carnival show. You dance, sing along, and just have a good time – and everyone around you is doing the same. Black Eyed Peas concerts are just so much fun. Be prepared to expect the unexpected too, because you never know what they're going to pull from their sleeves. Whenever they sing their hits that were popular years ago, it's instant nostalgia. Basically, their concerts make me super happy! Before I go, I'm singing ""Tonight's gonna be a good night"" (kind of like a warm-up) and then when they actually perform it during the concert, I go nuts! That song can't fail to bring you to your feet and put you in a good mood. Go see them: the Black Eyed Peas NEVER disappoint when performing live. ",
Black Eyed Peas,The performance was great. Singing and dancing was fantastic. The only negative point would be that there was a long wait between the supporting act and the band starting their performance. I don't think it's fair to leave your fans standing around for more then half an hour and waiting for the show to start. If there were any issues they could at least issue some apologies and explanation. ,
Black Eyed Peas,The best possible musical and artistical experience!! The show was filled with a lot of emotion and a lot of power that has driven the Peas since 1998 and their first album. The hits were from older days Pump it and Shut up to megahits like I gotta feeling and Big love with a perfect cream of Where is the love. A truly spectacular event! ,
Black Eyed Peas,The night was spectacular!!! Really enjoyed it so much!!! Glad that that break in 8 years is over and they are rolling out new albums and concerts again. ,
The Rolling Stones,"Sixteen hours after I left my house, and 50 years after forming as a band, The Rolling Stones took the gigantic stage at 9:30pm. The empty seats filled in quickly once Sheeran had taken his leave. At 50,000 strong, it was quite a site to see the crowd on their feet as the Stones kicked off their 3rd performance at Arrowhead Stadium (their first was ’75, their latest was in ’89) with “Start Me Up” from Tattoo You. The song is over 30 years old, but was nothing more than a baby when compared to most of the set list. “It’s Only Rock ‘n Roll” and “Tumbling Dice” set the precedent for a show that would include mostly material from before I was born. “Doom And Gloom” was the exception to the rule, but served to prove that even a mediocre song can be more than magnificent in the right hands. If I’m being honest, the main reason I was seeing The Rolling Stones was to check them off my list of legends. I had heard stories, but I couldn’t wrap my head around that fact that a bunch of 70-year-olds could still put on an epic show. Sure, the giant screens and incredible soundsystem and fireworks were to be expected, I even figured they would sound pretty good, but nothing prepared me for how animated they would be. Mick Jagger was a diva less than half his age as he strutted his shit up and down the catwalk. Wardrobe changes, grabbing phones from the crowd to take selfies, reminiscing about things that happened back in ’74…he was on point the entire night. - See more at: http://ilistensoyoudonthaveto.com/2015/07/01/the-rolling-stones-arrowhead-stadium-06-27-15/#sthash.hANemdD3.dpuf ",
The Rolling Stones,"""I know it's only Rock and Roll but I like it"". The Rolling Stones ""live in concert"" is an experience not to be missed. From the moment, Mick, Keith and the rest of Stones hit the stage until the final note of the encore - any room - no matter what size - will be filled with an energy level that is unparalleled! No two concerts are ever the same when it comes to the ""Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the world"". If you have not yet seen the Rolling Stones I encourage you to do so. I loved seeing the Rolling Stones when growing up in Toronto - at every possible venue in the Stones ""home away from home"". Each tour would feature band rehearsals at places like the Toronto airport hanger or at a local Bayview North Toronto school. Many a Stones tour would kick off in Toronto at Maple Leaf Gardens, CNE Stadium, Skydome and Air Canada Centre among others. Heck, when Keith Richards was busted in Toronto - he was sentenced to perform a charity concert for the CNIB in Oshawa. I have most of the Rolling Stones catalogue of music and DVDs and have thoroughly enjoyed the groups who have played in an opening capacity with the Stones. They helped introduce us to Ike and Tina Turner, Stevie Wonder, George Thorogood and the Destroyers and the White Stripes among others! You will never go wrong buying a Stones concert ticket. Make sure you do before it is too late. Mark S. Dutton, Concert Fan in Canada! ",
The Rolling Stones,"Hi there. The Rolling Stones in Prague the best show ever. The concert was absolutely amazing, fantastic, super great. The performance of the Rolling stones is in the highest quality, they are  the living legend,I love them for ever and wish to all of them the best off everything. Thank you for unforgettable experience. So this was about the show, but I would like to tell you my worst nightmare I also had just before the concert. I bought three tickets from Viagogo office and to my horror I find out that the tickets were not valid and they were not in database. I paid 23.000KC.So to get to the event I've had to buy another three tickets for standing. THERE WAS MORE fans off the Rolling stones with some experience. I don't what to do about the matter. So this was MY best experience and the worst. Yours Luda Horakova Krasicka 53 Prostejov Czech republic . ",
The Rolling Stones,"It doesn't matter where you sit at a Stones show, it's going to be memorable. This was my first time seeing them, much of my family have seen them multiple times. Heinz Field is an ok venue. Being so far back, the sound was just a smidge off but the atmosphere was still awesome. It rained heavily most of the day but by some great fortune, the clouds parted and the weather was perfect right before showtime. The blazed through hit after hit, with fireworks and lights and spectacle. The best thing, however, is how much Mick Jagger moves and his dancing and prancing. The dude is 72 and still has all the energy and charisma he had back in the day. It's insane. I defy anyone who can find a better showman and frontman than Mick Jagger. Keith, Ronnie, Charlie and the backing band were all incendiary. 10/10 would see them again. ",
The Rolling Stones,"I've seen several live performance by the Stones on TV and while I have been amazed by their energy levels considering their ages, I also have thought at times that their performances were lacking a bit.  Boy, was I wrong after seeing them live at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City!  Mick Jagger melted my face off with his energy, cockiness (man, does he strut!) and powerful vocals.  They were on-point for the entire show, and I thought it was cool that they brought opener Ed Sheeran onstage as well.  As a 30-something male, The Rolling Stones have always been on my bucket list, and I'm glad I had a chance to see them in person.  I would definitely recommend their show and would go see them again.  Hopefully they keep on rocking another 10-15 years! ",
The Rolling Stones,"It was a wonderful concert! My group and I had so much fun! Although we were not so close to the stage, thanks to the 3 gigantic screens it was possible to enjoy the concert fully. Mick Jagger has so much energy!!! They not only played most of their best songs, but invited Juanes ( one of the most famous Colombian singers to play guitarr and sing one song together with Mick. The public went crazy! At the end also invited the Javeriana Chorus (also Colombian) to sing with the group. Great! They started the concert with Jumping Jack Flash and then played as second a song picked by the colombian public in the internet. I found that very good. My group and I flew from Venezuela to Bogotá for the concert The Rolling Stones rock!!!!! LOVED IT!!!! ",
The Rolling Stones,"The doors opened at 4:45pm ( late by 45 mins). Support act ( Richard Ashcroft) didn’t come on till 7pm and  played for 45 minutes and they were really good. Stones came on at 8:15pm and played till 10:30. Utterly amazing, Mick Jagger can put on a show! The rest of the guys do look really, really old. I felt for Charlie Watts he looked sore.. However, £5.20 for a can of Tennats lager ( 89p in Morrisons) come on Murrayfield, you made a mental load of money. I’ve never seen so many pissed people at a concert, but enjoying themselves. Other reviews suggested they set was 22 songs, I counted 19 so don’t know if we were short changed because of the 1030 curfew. Great concert, T shirts £30 come on guys ... ",
The Rolling Stones,I've seen the stone's 7 times.75 crashed gate 78 81..stpaul c.f. center.89 mnpls.metro dome. 94&97 Seattle kingdome...2006 questfield seattle. 2016 Las vegas tmobil..all one as good as the next..the last one made me cry most of the last hour i was up for 2 days. And the music the memories of friends no longer here and i just got a total rush and the music just took over. The most powerfull show. I was just so overwhelmed to still be seeing them. The one constant.. trouble times good times the stones were always in my head. Thanx mike mckay ,
The Rolling Stones,"The Rolling Stones concert was absolutely amazing. The singing, the music, the lighting, the fireworks and those large screens were great. They strutted their stuff through all the favourite numbers and some other great songs. Before you go, read the list of items not allowed inside the concert because you will lose them. Handbags larger than A5 size not allowed, including bumbags, cameras and camera bags, to name a few. All in All, everything went very smoothly, everyone loved it and we all had an amazing night, never to be forgotten. ",
The Rolling Stones,"The greatest rock n roll band in the world - No doubt about it. Mick, Keef, Charlie and Ronnie were sensational. From the opening Street Fighting Man to the encores of Gimme Shelter and Satisfaction they were as great as ever. Mick was the imperious frontman, Keith the axe wielding lunatic, Charlie the rock upon which the driving rhythms of Paint it Black are built, Ronnie the joker whose rhythm guitar convinces you the Stones play the devil’s music. Sensational just sensational. It was a privilege to be there. ",
The Rolling Stones,AMAZING!!!!! Originally the price I paid was frightening and don't get me wrong I was in the nosebleeds and still went broke on a pair of seats 250.00 for the pair but when you get there and the huge hi def screens are there it feels like your in the front row complete with Pyro before and after the conclusion of the show the guys still sound amazing and mick WOW a ball of energy so awesome I would gladly spend the cash again to go see them again and am so fortunate I got to see them before it's to late ,
The Rolling Stones,"It was the best!!!! Set list couldn’t have been better. Saw them at Oldchella and in the 80’s with Prince at the colosseum. They just keep getting better as they become more seasoned...and cuter too!!!! the crowd was on their feet the whole time singing every word to all of the favorite songs.  Thank you Rolling Stones for being the band that you have become, I am so glad to have seen you for a third time which was the best time of all!!! Much love ",
The Rolling Stones,"One of the best shows I've ever been to, and I've been to a lot... after all these years they still got it! Mic Jaggers talent is outrageous. I'm sad this is their last tour. The only thing I'd like to mention is that because the show had been rescheduled from its original date, there were a lot of scams with tickets. Some were duplicated from the original date and there were a lot of people who had to buy new tickets or not be allowed into the show ",
The Rolling Stones,Mick & the boys rocked Dublin to its roots last Thursday night.The opening night of their NO Filter tour was awesome.Mick Jaggers energy on stage was nothing less than brilliant.Sympathy for the devil was the opening song Jagger erupted onto the stage to a chorus of Woo Woos from the crowd pure magic.The encore Gimme Shelter & Satisfaction left us all more than SATISFIED! Anyo me going to their other shows have one hell of a night in store. ,
The Rolling Stones,"It was, again, The Greatest Rock'n'Roll Show On Earth! The songs were a bit elongated. Which was OK, but maybe more songs could have fit. A bit more speed, I thought at first. But, I have to say, this speed with those men in there seventies was breathtaking already! A show of two full hours was very much OK with me. It was great to hear my sons, who acompanied me, saying that they where impressed by the show and the music. ",
The Rolling Stones,"The concert was a big present for the old and new fans. They played all the classics but without forgeting the BSides songs like Worried about You and Out of Control. No pauses, more than 20 songs and so much energy spent on stage as if they still needed to conquer these fans, already in love with the band. They are Gods among us. I saw them 20 years ago and now I had the same experience; Best rock n roll band of all times. ",
The Rolling Stones,"Just been to see Rolling Stones at Murrayfield Stadium.My husband is 70 I am 63 and m’y Son in Law is 37 and we all Saïd it was thé Best concert ever by à country mile. Their catalogue of music is so vast that they could  do à completely différent one  next Time and we Would still be happy. Brilliant show, fabulous Backing singers and musicians. Please Rolling Stones Côme back next year and do it again. ",
The Rolling Stones,"Not having seen the band live for 36 years I was really looking forward to the gig at Murrayfield and I wasn’t disappointed. The Stones were absolutely brilliant, pumping out a high energy stream of their greatest songs. From the opening Start Me Up to the final Satisfaction I can’t recall being so pleased I’d come to a gig. PS can I have a pint of whatever energy drink Mick’s been drinking ! ",
The Rolling Stones,"Great show at Arrowhead. Mick was energetic, humorous, and was giving each song his full attention. Charlie laid down a consistent beat all night which seemed effortless. Keith and Ron were playing with vigor and seemed to be having great fun. The accompanying musicians were tremendous. They complemented a rock and roll band that played a legitimately fantastic performance from start to finish. ",
The Rolling Stones,Awesome show they still know how to rock a crowd no doubt the greatest rock band of all time no one else will ever come close to what these guys have done for music all this new electronic music is pure garbage and once bands like this are gone you will at least have the music that will live on forever thanks Mick Keith Ronnie and Charlie for a concert experience I will never forget. ,
Sia,"One of the world's most prolific songwriters, Sia Furler's songs are cropping up in charts worldwide on the regular. Having worked with Britney Spears, Rihanna and Beyoncé (to name but a few) to acclaim and success, Sia also strikes out on her own. Delivering devastating pop paeans that discuss loss, depression, death, addiction, sex, drugs and, on occasion, happy things, Sia's not a bespandexed pop mannequin; she's a bona fide artist, reeling off the most incisive pop you'll ever hear. Chances are, if you knew of Sia's solo efforts prior to this year, you'll be familiar with “Breathe Me”, a tender earthquake of a song, replete with her trademark vocal crackles, clips and croaks. However, bursting forth proper, in 2014 we've seen an abundance of top-notch belters; the overwhelming hysteria of “Chandelier”, “Eye Of The Needle” and “Big Girls Cry” is enough to make anyone combust. Her strategy in recent months, in terms of performing live, has been unusual – reticent, even. For example, on the Ellen Show, she merely faced the back of the set as the dancer from the “Chandelier” video, Maddie Ziegler, pranced as a centrepiece. When she does allow the spotlight to be shone on her, the standout element is her voice. Her singular talent is extraordinary, oozing the kind of heartstring-yanking emotion you get when watching Titanic, reading The Fault In Our Stars... it's a combination of blazing stomach-butterflies, the silent, catastrophic crumble of our universe. Her voice escapes words, frequently. Her pitch is of course flawless; and as a spectacle before your eyes, she's majestic. Make sure to bring tissues. Sia's performances will change your life. ",
Sia,"Absolutely amazing! I was skeptical, for some reason, after reading a couple of mediocre reviews from the Nostalgia tour, but my skepticism eased as soon as the curtains opened and I heard Sia sing live! What an amazing voice! Actually, just watching her stand on stage was enough for me! Although she's not a ""performer"", she definitely put on a show. Her stage presence is entrancing! I could literally watch her stand in a corner, tap her heel to the beat while grasping the mic and belting that amazing voice all day. Her dancers, of course, were phenomenal! I mean, really! The show moved fast - from song to song - almost like acts in a play, but it was quite enjoyable. She opened with Alive, which was great for getting the energy throughout the packed arena! Big Girls Cry, Bird Set Free, Cheap Thrills and Breathe Me were my performances! She sang every song I wanted to hear so I didn't leave disappointed! There was no interaction between the artist and the crowd during the show - which I expected from the reviews I read. But after the final bows and as everyone was leaving, Sia spoke! She told everyone to stay seated while she thanked the crowd. Made us laugh and performed an encore! It was THE BEST THING EVER! So much fun! Great energy. Everyone was there for a great time. This was literally the best concert I've attended! So glad to have caught Sia on tour! Btw: Miguel was an opening act. He was awful! He's not a performer. Reminded me a lot of a high school boy band wannabe! He tried to engage the crowd but I don't think too many people cared to see him. His band was good though! ",
Sia,"Sia is by no means a performer known for her strict adherence to convention, but even by her own standards, she’s been acting strangely lately, in the run-up to the release of her sixth studio album, 1000 Forms of Fear. Firstly, she told The Sunday Times that she didn’t want to be famous, apparently not realising that giving interviews to British national newspapers probably isn’t an ideal part of that strategy. More sensibly, she stayed out of the limelight during a performance on primetime U.S. television recently, although she did let Lena Dunham perform an interpretive dance to her track instead - a bizarre move by anybody’s standards.    Quite what will be in store for audiences when she does hit the road in support of 1000 Forms of Fear remains to be seen, especially if she’s set on keeping her face hidden - a Kanye West-style mask, perhaps? We can probably expect an array of eye-catching costumes, and if past form is anything to go by, the setlist will lean heavily on her latest record - she’s not one to do things by the book on that front, either. She did away with the piano on her last tour, and given her current direction, that’s likely to be the case this time, too; beyond that, though, it probably isn’t sensible to jump to too many conclusions about one of the world’s most unpredictable pop acts. ",
Sia,"Firstly, I love Sia as the most amazing singer/songwriter and being able to attend her live concert was something I was greatly looking forward to. I wasn't expecting to see her face and I was prepared for that.  What I wasn't prepared for was her standing off to the side of the stage in darkness and the audience watching dancers for the entire concert whilst Sia sang to her own music track. Throughout the concert I wasn't even certain that it actually was Sia there on stage and was she singing live at all or were we just listening to her CD playing while someone was miming. The lighting was low and didn't focus on her and she remained in the dark for the whole concert.  The tv's placed around the stadium did not sinc to what Sia was singing. To sum it up, I still adore her and will buy her music.  She just should not tour if she cannot give what some concert goers want when they pay big bucks to see an artist. ",
Sia,"I have loved Sia's voice and her music for several years now.  The venue, Phillips Arena, was phenomenal for the concert.  That's why we paid $205 to see the her (and Miguel).  That said, I found it disrespectful of her to stand up in a corner and sing (honestly, it looked like lip-synching sometimes).  Who knows, it might have been be someone else performing on her behalf. I get it on TV presentations... and certainly was hoping that wasn't the case in the concert but sadly it was. Miguel... not giving any credit to the band behind the screen...  rude! I will not see Sia or Miguel live again... very disappointed. Thanks for asking. Best, Maria ",
Sia,"I should have just stayed home and watch the video. It was difficult to tell if she was even singing. She sounded exactly like her recordings. Even Shazam could recognize the songs.     The performers on stage were trying to sequence and dance with the simultaneously played video, shown on the screens. Many times they were out of sync Sia was trying to sing at the same sequence as the video, but many times was out of sync.  The audience doesn't know whether to look at the screen or look at the stage it's like two different shows, but the screen was far more entertaining. Like I said I should have stayed home and watch the video. ",
Sia,"Electrifying show. Sia's vocal abilities are amazing, She sings her soul out. The dancers were outstanding too, and the choreography was wild and creative. loved it. The Idea of making the video clips of her songs live on stage is nice, but very much limited. We all saw those clips over and over, and we came to see something else. I missed seeing her, Sia, her face when she sings, She was at the back of the stage for the whole show, with her face covered. Wanted her to make some connection with the crowd, and it didn't happen. With all that we had an amazing time. ",
Sia,"First, I'd like to preface my review by saying that Sia is  my absolute favourite artist!That would be the short and simple review, but that wouldn’t even begin to describe the experience that you get at one of her shows. Apart from the vocal performance of Sia being amazing, there is much more to her show.  It was very unique concert!  With a lot of Sia magic and mystery. Amazing dancers. Great Stephanie Mincone performance. Amazing vocal performance!! Thank you Sia!! ",
Sia,"Truly one of the best performances I've seen. Sia's voice was on top shape and, even though she was on the back of the stage and covered, she was a powerful presence. The performances by the dancers on every song were expertly choreographed and in perfect sync with the videos projected, so the illusion of having Paul Dano, Kristen Wiig, and Tig Notaro on stage with her was very good. ",
Sia,excellent show so glad I was able to attended it was a birthday present.  And enjoyed every minute wish she could have kept going all night LOVE HER. Took my granddaughter with me and she love the show too.  Didn't appreciate  Miguel have the us say F### Trump I did go there for that purpose I went to enjoy the show but he still gave a great performance except for that. ,
Sia,"What can I say about my girl Sia? Her voice is amazing and the dancers were spot on. I've seen Sia multiple times and never been disappointed. I was actually shocked when Sia sung ""Breathe Me."" Sia is an artist I will see anytime....been following her since Zero 7. I just love her music and voice! She is something special in my book. ",
Sia,Sia was absolutely fantastic! A true entertainer! What a voice! Concert started at 7 with Miguel as her opener. He did a great job. Sia took the stage around 9:15 and sang for approximately an hour and a half sang all her hits and then some.  I would watch her again and again. Perfection!! ,
Sia,The concert was off the chain. Her voice was amazing. The crowd never sat down during the entire concert. The little girl dancer Maddie performance was insane. There were a couple of actors performing interpretive dances as well (ex: Kristen Wiig and Paul Dano). ,
Sia,I'm a huge sia fan and have been wanting to see her forever! I was in row 16 on floor level and it was amazing!! She doesn't move from her spot and her dancers are the show. But her voice is one of the most amazing things ever! I loved her show! ,
Sia,"THAT WAS THE BEST SHOW I'VE EVER SEEN!!!!!! Sia was amazing, Maddie was awesome, all of the dancers were PERFECT! It was AWESOME!!! I never wanted to leave!!!! I wish I had the money to go follow her and see all of her concerts!!! ",
Sia,The whole concept of the concert was amazing and of course her performance was flawless. The venue was big enough but not too big and the sound was great. It was for sure one of the best concerts I've been to. ,
Sia,"Sydney show. Like going to a stadium to watch rage. Pre-recorded visuals and vocals, very dull, very boring and expensive. Not made for a stadium gig. It was an utter disappointment. Worst gig of the year. ",
Sia,"Powerful music, creative dancing, and weird videos, this show had it all!  It truly felt like an event.  A mixture of new songs and older ones made it interesting for every level of fan.  Terrific show! ",
Flo Rida,"Flo Rida has been around rap for a while so it's no surprise that he's gotten better and better over the years – but what really impresses me about his live performances is the fact that he really engages with the audience and makes them feel welcome from the very moment he enters the stage. It kind of makes me sad that many people know of his songs because they have heard them around, but they don't actually know him because they don't make that connection. But if you get tickets to one of his shows, you'll never forget him – when everything is said and done people will always remember his performances. While the venues Flo Rida plays tend to be rather large these days, he creates a closeness between him and us in the audience: you'll feel like you're really close to him. Whether it's when he asks us to jump or dance in a certain way once the song hits a certain point, or by asking the audience directly after each song finishes which song they would like to hear him perform next by gauging how loudly they cheer when he asks. He goes to great lengths when performing to make sure that the audience knows he is actually singing (not just lip-syncing) over the music by changing not only his pitch, but his timing to the song, so that when he plays ""I Get A Good feeling"" it's not like just listening to the recording. He's great at suddenly changing the mood of a show, and there are some light-hearted moments like when he brings on a whistle as a prop when playing ""Blow My Whistle""! It's hard to explain how much he makes his shows fit to the fans in the crowd – like getting us to sing certain parts of a song, or asking direct questions and getting us to cheer ""yes"" or ""no"", and then using this information to segue into another song that is related to the question so as to ensure that the audience feels a part of the performance and what is happening in it. Flo Rida isn't just another rap act, his shows aren't just another rap show. Every show is different, and the only way you can really experience that is to go and see him for yourself. ",
Flo Rida,"American rapper and producer Tramar Lacel Dillard better known by his stage name Flo Rida has become a household name in recent years following a string of commercially successful singles. The man himself has gained a large following for his easy listening and recognisable music that sits somewhere between pop and dance with rap also often included by Flo. His live show relies heavily on the show element, with visual interludes being included throughout and an accompaniment of dancers, DJs and hype-men. They all perform well and hype the crowd for hits including 'Good Feeling' and 'Whistle'. Tramar rarely remains stationery throughout the evening as he moves around the stage making sure every single audience member is having a really great time. By the finale of his collaboration with Sia, 'Wild Ones' Flo Rida has proven he is well and truly an entertainer and still cares about his live show now made up exclusively of hits. He has saved perhaps his most recognisable track for an encore, 'Low' has a far more hiphop influence and it is the first time that Dillard demonstrates his freestyle abilities whilst the whole crowd gets low beneath the stage. ",
Flo Rida,"I saw Flo Rida perform at the O2 arena, in front of thousands of screaming fans. The large venue and crowd size perfectly suited Flo Rida, as his music is so catchy and fun that it can easily entertain a roaring mass. Flo Rida dominated the stage, and really brought the party. He had the oddest microphone, in the shape of a horn, that the crowd just went crazy for. At one point during his performance he even jumped down from the stage into the audience, a move that was met with rapturous applause and ear shattering screams. I had a standing ticket, which allowed for optimum dancing space. The entire crowd was dancing and singing along to Flo Rida’s tunes, all of which were classics of his. Flo Rida sang ‘Good Feeling’, ‘Right Round’, ‘Whistle’, ‘Wild Ones’, ‘Club Can’t Handle Me’ and ‘Jump’, all of which received a great crowd reaction. The greatest thing about the concert was the fact that everyone knew all of the songs that were performed. When the track for ‘Low’ came on, the crowd went absolutely ballistic and the energy was just fantastic. ",
Flo Rida,"Long awaited and booked months in advance but the concert was postponed with no new date as yet, sadly!!  We hope that it will not be too long before a new date for the German leg of the tour is announced.  Looking forward to it when and if it happens. Wh ",
Flo Rida,Great show. High-powered energy and good music. Came through the crowd and interacted with everyone. Kissed babies and made everyone feel good. Loved the female dancers twerking. Made the place bounce and everyone was getting crunk. ,
J. Cole,"J. Cole is sometimes an underappreciated artist and I believe that the astuteness of his lyrics are not given enough credit. As a huge fan, I knew I couldn’t miss his live performance in London (December 2013) as soon as I heard of it.  At the Hammersmith Apollo, the anxiety of the fans was notorious. After jamming to hot hip-hop tracks with Tim Westwood in the pre-show, it was nice to see another Dreamville member doing his thing as Bas stepped on stage. For a rap artist, Cole made quite a big entrance, which included great lighting and some amazing background singers. In this concert, he sang most of the “Born Sinner” tracks (“Crooked Smile,” “Power Trip,” “She Knows"" and  “Forbidden Fruit” – to name a few,) his latest album at the time of the event, which was expected by the fans. But that was far from being his setlist. He managed to include hits from his first album as well as songs from his mixtapes, which were even better received from the audience. Although some rappers tend to not sing the whole tracks or skip the chorus vocals, Cole gave it all and sang every verse, keeping the energy high.  One of the most memorable moments was when he started singing “Light Please” in a very calm ambient, giving room for the fans who followed him from the start to sing along. But what really marked me in his show was not only his honest and down-to-earth talks in between songs, but the fact he gave the fans a chance to choose extra songs. As a result, he sang a few unexpected tracks like “Back to the Topic” from a mixtape and also “Is She Gon Pop” from the latest album. In sum, J. Cole didn’t disappoint at all and totally made my trip worthwhile. In fact, he made me want to keep following his work and be attentive to future shows. ",
J. Cole,"J Cole was absolutely insane at O2!! I had the time of my life listening to my favourite artist live! As corny as it sounds, I could feel like the music in my whole body and could feel the emotion in every lyric he sang. If you're a Cole fan, I definitely recommend going to see him live because it will multiply the love you have for him because he's just so fucking incredible at connecting with the audience! His narrative and general stage presence is so intense there were so many moments I felt completely surreal jumping and singing to his voice. Such a memorable and perfect night I can't even properly word it!! The supporting acts (Ari Lennox and Earthgang - J.I.D was also there but I missed him I think) were also brilliant. Having the crowd chant 'Fuck Donald Trump!' really got me pumped (Earthgang), and overall, J Cole managed to keep everyone in the audience jumping, shouting, dancing and sweating till the very last second. I didn't know what and how much I was missing out on before I went to this concert, and every time he confirms a tour, I'll be the first to book tickets because he's a fucking legend who can sing, rap and write the most awe-inspiring songs! ",
J. Cole,"Jermaine Lamarr Cole, better known by his stage name of J. Cole is an elusive visitor to the British isles yet when he does happen to appear, his devoted fan base flock to see this talented artist perform live. An intelligent lyricist and a sincere live performer, as the house lights fall on the hushed chatter of the crowd, Cole appears in humble manner leading on his band and backing singers. The sound is near perfect in the venue and you can hear every single word perfectly annunciated during opener 'Trouble'. The crowd has clearly been waiting a while to see Jermaine perform as they sing back the lyrics with such force and dedication. Cole thanks them profusely for this before moving on to other fan favourites such as 'Nobody's Perfect', his collaboration with Mary J. Blige. The speed in which Cole can freestyle keeps the audience cheering along yet it is early singles 'Who Dat' and 'Can't Get Enough' that send them into frenzy. Clearly enjoying himself onstage, J. Cole performs huge versions of these tracks before thanking the crowd for enjoying a show they will not be forgetting anytime soon. ",
J. Cole,"J. Cole last night was amazing. Bringing his dreamville team he had Bas, Cozz and Omen warm up the crowd with beats that got us all searching em up on our way home from the venue. Soon J.Cole walks on stage and the crowd is screaming, cheering for 5 min straight, everybody in the venue is standing up, jumping with excitement. And the excitement is getting more and more real as he preforms every song from his new  ""forest hills drive"" album along with some old joints from his album ""The Sideline Story"" like ""work out"" and ""lights please"". The vibe is intimate and turnt at the same time in the little venue sentrum scene in Oslo is. He takes time to appreciate  everybody that came out to see him and deliver an amazing music experience with his rhymes and presence. Thank YOU Cole. ",
J. Cole,"The whole lineup was phenomenal! He really inspired and made it very personal. That is what an artist is suppose to do. He performed the whole album and a few from his previous albums. I have been a J. Cole fan since day one. When my boyfriend and I were just best friends singing ""Best Friend"" and that being my ringtone to ""just like a star"" and just growing with his music. My boyfriend is an aspiring rapper and honestly this concert gave him the motivation, while listening to J.Cole I watch my boyfriends eyes light up while the hair stood up on his arms. J.Cole please come back again. We will always be a fan! You put on a great show Big Sean, great, Jeremih, awesome and YG we want more music you had the crowd going! Best concert I've been to in a while! ",
J. Cole,"I saw J cole last night in Dublin, it was the most amazing experience of my life, He truly is an amazing person and He showed us his past and let us see what each song was about, which I thought was a great add to the concert and made it more personal. If I could, I would repeat last night over and over again, and I would never get sick of it, j cole is a MUST SEE, also such a kind man Aswel, have huge respect for him and his opinions. Also- as he told us last night he has a bit of Irish in him as his grandmother went on the boat from ireland to America, and his grandmother gave birth to his mother, and his mother gave birth to J Cole. How amazing is that !!!! ",
J. Cole,"One of the best shows I've ever had the pleasure of attending. At first, I was pissed that I couldn't find a date, despite getting the tickets months in advance. However, before long, Cole made me forget all about my dismal love life, and reminded me of why I do my social activism. If we don't demand change, we'll keep getting a red, white, blue dildo jammed up our rear ends. To put it another way, change is inevitable. Will it be ultimately for the better or worst, is the question though. Also, what will we tell our children's children when they ask us what did we honestly do to make the world a better place for them? ",
J. Cole,"Hooooly shit was that good! This man knows how to put on a show, I tell you hwat! Even though the band wasn't featured, we knew they were there, and the musicianship was stellar. The man who was featured delivered the goods. He didn't just stand there, hiding behind a fancy coat, sunglasses and a crap-ton of bling. He brought energy and feeling to his set that made his openers' sets feel lackluster. When he spoke, I believed him. I felt his heart. One of the best shows I've ever seen. Oh, and kudos to Honda Center and the soundsystem. Really good sound isn't always easy to come by in an arena, and they killed it! ",
J. Cole,"Beyond my expectations! J Cole is so humble, speaks the truth and really wants to resonate his energy, thoughts, beliefs, and opinions with his audience! Not only did he play songs from his current hit album, 4 Your Eyes Only but hit it back to 2014, Forest Hill Drive and if you were digging him from the beginning with songs such as Nobody's Perfect etc. It was an amazing concert and I'm glad I went. It's all about investment. You either are willing to spend a certain amount of money, in them good seats and see and hear J Cole, or you couldn't be bothered. For me, the investment was worthwhile! ",
J. Cole,"The best concert ever Jermaine (j.cole) is truly an amazing soul he performed for 2 hours nonstop ! Interacted with his supporters you can't really say that about other rappers who just perform for 30 minutes and go about their day , also in the show j.cole explained his songs from the album and also picked a fan to sing with him it was an amazing experience I was on the big screen twice & and he acknowledged my poster this was my first time seeing him but it won't be my last ! I love you Jermaine Lamarr Cole Thank you so much for last night . ",
J. Cole,"Fantastic concert. J. Cole performed most of his new album (KOD) throughout the concert and tied it all together in a way that was really well thought out. But he also was sure to play old favourites. He engaged with the audience and spoke about what the album meant for him and what he hopes it will do for everyone else. I had high expectations and he passed them. His supporting vocals, musicians, DJ, lighting technicians, etc. were all on point too. It was better than I could've expected and I went in with high expectations. ",
J. Cole,"Best concert I've ever attended, and I've been to a lot! YG could have been more exciting. Jeremih was wonderful, but Big Sean and J. Cole both were OUTSTANDING! Not only was the performance great, the energy level in the crowd was high, everyone was hyped up and (especially when J. Cole performed) being in the crowd, screaming along the lyrics with everyone else and having a great time, nothing is better! J. Cole is one of the best rappers and lyrically talented. Will definitely see him live again! ",
J. Cole,"This was our first experience of seeing an artist in a big arena. J. Cole did not disappoint at all, the show was amazing. His supporting Acts Ari Lennox, Earthgang and JID were also very good. He has such an amazing presence on stage it was unreal. We could feel what he was singing and rapping about even though we were up top, the atmosphere he created in the arena with his music was electrifying. Cannot wait to go his show again when he comes back to the UK. Highly recommend. ",
J. Cole,"Well, the concert was as I expected it to be. Sadly, his album '4 Your Eyes Only' isn't a good live album and you could see that he knew it too. He tried too hard to make those songs 'go hard', but you simply can't change a calm song to a hard-hitting song. As soon as he started playing songs from his previous albums the crowd started bouncing and overall the mood was lifted. Therefore I would call the concert two-faced and would rate it 6.5/10. ",
J. Cole,"Amazing show!!!! I got there at 6:50 and doors opened at 7. I got front row action and was not disappointed. It was very hot and SUPER crowded. J. Cole showed us major love on the stage by performing old classics. Even once the show was over and he seen how the crowd were chanting for more, he came back out and did a few more versus. The king showed up and showed out. This was my 2nd J. Cole concert. Thank you! ",
J. Cole,This man was absolutely amazing. He never ever disappoints. It's like he just keeps getting better and better with every show. He had my breath gone I felt like I couldn't even breathe for a portion of some songs. This is a do not miss concert. And the set up of the concert is so personable because he's directly in the middle of the arena. Oh I love Jermaine. I will never miss a concert and never have I. ,
J. Cole,"Well, it has been a really great Show.. J cole was incredible, especially his singing and rhymes and also the band in the background which played his songs with lots of soul. The only thing that i dindnt like was that the part of j cole was way too short and the pre-acts were too long.. But in conclusion i would definitely visit one of j coles concerts again and can fully recommend it. ",
J. Cole,"I.Cole was absolutely amazing as usual. This is like my third time seeing him in concert and every time gets better and better. If you haven't gone to see him live, you're missing out. He connects with you on a personal level through his lyrics...he connects with your soul and not just your mind. His lyrics will have you thinking about your life and what's next for it. he's just amazing. ",
J. Cole,Personally i think there were too many opening acts. Also when the opening acts were done it took almost 45 mins for him to get on stage. But it was all worth it when he came because his actual performance was amazing. He makes his concerts feel so personal like you're just sitting in a room with him singing. Also I love the times where he just stopped raping and talked about the songs. ,
J. Cole,Great show my j.cole came in a bit sceptical but he killed it he went through a lot of the hit songs on his catalogue yet focused on r your eyez only he made it seem like he was talking to an audience member personally which somehow made me and the people around me forget about how tired our feet were or how we where all bunched up together and diverted our attention the the music ,
Big Sean,"Big Sean's concerts are a lot like his music: heavy on the beats and the bass, a little irreverent, and jocular. You never know what he'll pull out of his sleeve. During smash hit ""High,"" he stumbles on stage as though intoxicated. When the time comes to perform hit ""Clique,"" he'll bring other GOOD Music members onstage to rap their parts live. And don't be surprised if he sheds a tear during his more emotional tracks, like the aptly-named ""Memories."" Fan appreciation if a major part of Big Sean's shows. He focuses on keeping the crowd engaged, whether it's dancing or rapping along (or both!). To connect, he might jump into the crowd for a little surfing, or clasp hands with as many audience members as possible. And that high-energy attitude extends to his performances, too--he makes a point to rap over instrumentals, eschewing backing vocals. His attitude is always tempered by humor; the bragging is never offensive. He jokes with the crowd to warm them up at the beginning. He'll pull off his shirt to prove he has no tattoos--his mother doesn't approve of them. And he thanks her for everything she has taught him in between songs. The humor, the emotions, and the booty-shaking music make his concerts feel like one big party, one you'll want to go to again. ",
Big Sean,"Big Sean, now a notorious name on the US R & B circuit is an unpredictable and exciting live performer who has serious talent to match his impressive discography. He has worked with some of the most celebrated names in the industry so his choices when choosing tracks to perform is almost endless. He sticks to the safe bets of 'Mercy' and 'Higher' which the audience cheer for and attempt to sing/rap at the speed of the man himself. He covers tracks by some of his favourite contemporaries including J. Cole and Drake, and having shared stages with most of them you can never rule out a guest appearance. On this evening the duet was with none other than Kanye West who performed his own track 'Gold Digger' with Big Sean as well as their smash collaboration 'Clique'. The audience could hardly control their excitement at this all star pairing as they cheered and screamed at maximum volume as Sean confidently baits them for more. A man with true stage presence and great connections is without a doubt going to put on a show that will have people talking for days after. ",
Big Sean,The opening act was not very good and did a bad job at pumping the crowd up. We waited about an hour before his friends finally came out to introduce him but then it took another solid half hour for him to even come out. Still all of the time was worth it because the buildup was amazing and when he came out everyone went crazy. Long story short I passed out from dehydration and I would still see him again ,
Big Sean,Big Sean shut the JOE down that night. The floor was shaking and the energy in the crowd was literally explainable. The concert was worth way more than the price I payed. I fell even more in love with Big Sean and his music after the concert had ended. He's a real artist who gives back to the community he comes from. ,
Big Sean,"Big Sean was amazing, his energy never dropped. Even when he was singing the slow songs, you could really feel how hyped the crowd was. He brought made in Tokyo out on stage and then preformed together. It was made in tokyo's birthday so we all sang Happy birthday! He played the new album and the old singles. ",
Big Sean,"The Fillmore is small and gets crowded easy. But, having been first row, I found the show very enjoyable. Great performance, great theatrics, great lighting, great track list. The only problem really did lie in the crowd's behavior. As an avid fan, this show was well worth it. ",
Big Sean,"Big Sean was dope in his set at the concert. I was impressed that he did his set without dancers or a hype man. He took no breaks and remained energetic. He gave the crowd his energy, and the crowd gave it right back. Its the kind of show I like. Props to Big Sean. ",
Big Sean,"He was beyond amazing !! We had a great time watching his performance despite that he made the crowd go crazy, I encourage anyone who's debating, shouldn't because watching him live is way better than listening to his music. Spectacular ",
Big Sean,amazing! better than RiRi very authentic and enthusiastic he put his heart into this sadly the crowd was lame enjoyed it thorougly big sean rocks he also played champions which was great all live ,
Foo Fighters,"So I very recently reviewed an epic night with the Foo Fighters in DC for the 4th of July. Everything came together perfectly for the Foo's 20th Anniversary Show. Dave Grohl and company played the hits, as well as their debut album almost in its entirely. You can read the full review here. But somehow, that show wasn't the Foo concert I was most excited for this year. No...that would be their huge Boston gig at the Beloved Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox. (I'm a huge Sox fan) I had purchased presale tix to this back in November, and it was a long 8 months waiting for the highly anticipated weekend. When it finally arrived, Boston was ready for it. Prior to the show, I walked over to a 'pop up shop' selling Foo Fighters memorabilia, only to realize their was a 20 minute wait to get into the store. The Fenway show was sold out with approximately 35,000 people in attendance. And this was just night 1 of 2 in Boston. Following opening sets by Boston favorites Mission of Burma, and Mighty Mighty Bosstones, the Foo's came on right at 8pm. As was similar to the DC show, the first half was completely based on Foo Fighters greatest hits. The first 90 minutes was single after single spanning the entire Foo catalogue. Best moment came in the middle of the set when Grohl crutched down to the end of stage and received some acoustic help from his guitarists. As they did in DC, Foo's chose to perform two of the best songs acoustically with 'My Hero' and 'Times Like These.' The volume at which the Fenway crowd sang 'My Hero' was a true highlight of the night, and may have been the best song. Lead singer Dave Grohl definitely took some time to talk to the Fenway crowd. He explained how this was the Foo's first stadium tour, and how that was a long time coming. He listed past venues played in Boston, and what the city means to him. He also told a great story of losing his High School Battle of the Bands competition and jokingly asked what the band that won was doing tonight. This was prior to covering Queen's 'Under Pressure.' Overall, Grohl was in a chatty and pleasant mood. With the injury still bothering Grohl, the guys skipped leaving stage for the encore and played straight through until about 10:45 (just shy of a 3 hour show, and passing the 10:30 curfew). The final closer was 'Best of You,' giving the Fenway crowd one more chance to sign along with the rock band. The only negative I would say is that since the first half of the show was so focused on the hits, the second half seemed a bit lacking. With the exception of 'Best of You,' they had nothing left to play in the last hour that could generate the same reaction and sing a long as the first 90 minutes. Maybe they could have just spaced out the most popular tunes more. But really it was an awesome set and even more of an epic night because of the venue. Fenway is the ballpark I grew up seeing Sox games at, so it was definitely a pretty special experience to come back and see one of my favorite bands play there. I won't be forgetting this one and look to see it towards the top of the 'Best Shows of 2015' list. Concert Rating: 4.5 Stars ",
Foo Fighters,"Have seen Dave Grohl solo, singing with his kids at the Fox Theater in Oakland for a UCSF ""Notes and Words"" benefit for very ill children. Amazing solo performance and moving to see him playing for his daughter Violet as she sang an Adele song. Tickets for show in San Jose in 2018 which was OK, but large arena (home of San Jose Sharks) and Cal Jam 2018. Cal Jam was very special as Dave, Pat, and Krist reunited to play a six song set of Nirvana songs, with John McCauley fronting for three songs and Joan Jett for three more. Only second reunion: first at Nirvana hall of fame induction; but this was the first at a concert open to us regular people. Made my spine tingle as much as if I could have attended a Beatles reunion. Dave was a monster on the drums, Pat killed it on the guitar, and Kris put forth his unique manner of playing bass. No bad locations at that venue. Pit, fixed seating, and lawn behind, so oldsters like me could sit during some of the warm up bands. Most recently saw the Foos at the Intersect Festival in Las Vegas this month. Less passion in this performance and while my favorite member of the Foos is Pat, he appeared intoxicated, totally spacing out at one point and cut off by Dave during his short solo for introductions. Wish he would skip the bottle of champagne on the stage. Did not like the Vegas venue, as in a very large tent with heavy smoking, excessive drinking, people holding up large signs blocking the view of many behind, and a nasty fistfight right in front of me with a drunk obnoxious guy getting the s**t kicked out of him by about 8 guys. Guess Dave did not see, as he is not tolerant of violence at this concerts. This was center stage about 10 people back, right in front of him. Had another very drunk woman come up and start grinding on me, looking as if she would vomit at any moment. Thankfully she left holding her mouth. I was not excited about the project of trying to find my way from front, center covered in her vomit. Vegas is a city of excess, and everything at this Amazon sponsored event seemed excessive. There were more bars than food stands. I was sick for a week from all of the smoke exposure. Hope they return to Cal Jam, keep indoor venues non-smoking, and definitely avoid the tent gigs. ",
Foo Fighters,"Amazing, astonishing every other adjectives you can think off to describe something awesome. Only a band like the Foo Fighters can make up a surprise concert 3 days before and sell out in the first hour that the tickets go on sale. Dave Grohl, is a master of music and there is no doubt about it! His presence on the stage is unbelievable. Sure knows how to throw a party. Me and maybe everybody just went with the idea of a Foo Fighters concert but we got so much more than that. Dave brought some of his friends to play along on his bash and boy where they great. Guests like: Paul Stanley, Jakc Black and Kyle Gass (Tenacious D), Slash, David Lee Roth, Alice Cooper, Perry Farrel, Lemmy Kilmister and others, like a surprise guess named Trombone Shorty and you guessed it, he jammed along the band with a TROMBONE! Was amazing, something new and even Dave said he didn't know how they could top that. Dave was the best host EVER, he didn't rest for three and a half hours, the whole concert, he was kicking, screaming, shredding, running... NON STOP. 1. Detroit Rock City w/Paul Stanley, 2. Do You Love Me w/Paul Stanley, 3. All My Life, 4. Rope, 5. The Pretender, 6. My Hero, 7. Tie Your Mother Down (Queen cover with Tenacious D and Slash), 8. Immigrant Song (Led Zeppelin cover with Tenacious D and Slash), 9. Congregation, 10. Walk, 11. School’s Out w/Alice Cooper, 12. I’m Eighteen w/Alice Cooper, 13. Cold Day in the Sun w/Taylor Hawkins on vocals, 14. Monkey Wrench, 15. Two Headed Dog /w Nick Oliveri, 16. Learn to Fly, 17. White Limo, 18. Arlandria 19. N.I.B. w/Zakk Wylde, 20. Fairies Wear Boots w/Zakk Wylde, 21. Times Like These, 22. Outside, 23. Mountain Song w/Perry Farrell, 24. Miss You w/ Perry Farrell, 25. Something From Nothing, 26. This Is a Call ft. Trombone Shorty jam session, 27. Best of You, 28. Panama w/David Lee Roth 29. Ain’t Talkin’ ‘Bout Love w/ David Lee Roth 30. Everlong, 31. Let It Rock (Chuck Berry cover with Motorhead’s Lemmy Kilmister, Slash and Zakk Wylde) ",
Foo Fighters,"Words can barely describe the experience of a Foo Fighters concert. I've seen them again and again because to me, their shows are the epitome of a true Rock and Roll experience. From the moment I walk into the stadium, I can feel the buzz and energy of the crowd as the anticipation of the beginning of the show is growing. And once the lights dim and the first chord of the first song (usually ""Times Like These"" or ""All My Life"") is played, the audience erupts and the show has begun. The Foos always put on such a loud and energetic performance, pulling the crowd into the show and causing a bit of a frenzy! They usually have an amazing light show that is timed to go amazingly with the music and it's that kind of detail that really pulls you into their performance – you might have to check if there's going to be strobe lighting before you go. Dave Grohl is very fun and friendly with the crowd, taking the time to make jokes and have fun with those lucky enough to be on the front row (it's pretty hard to get that close though). If you go see them, you'll absolutely get your money's worth: the many times that I have seen the Foo Fighters they have always played a long set, close to 2 hours, which is awesome, as they have such a large catalog of music you're dying to hear. So by the end of the show, I always feel that I was able to hear all of my favorite songs! By the time the show ends and I'm leaving the stadium, I'm completely exhausted, thrilled, pumped up and really happy about the experience. I generally don't have much of a voice left, from shouting and singing along – but even then, I'm already finding myself getting excited for the next time I get to see them play live!!! And then I hit the parking lot and there's the same energy among everyone leaving – it's a great shared feeling, but it's so clear that everyone had an amazing time!! ",
Foo Fighters,"ONE OF THE GREATEST SHOWS I HAVE EVER BEEN TO! The Foo Fighters has’t played a concert in Florida in 12 years and they had finally came. They played everything from their debut album all the way to their newest album Concrete and Gold. “All my Life”, “Run”, “The Pretender”, “This is a Call”, “Breakout”,and “Everlong” are some examples of what they played! Every song they played sounded crisp and clean. I prefer them live now over prerecorded stuff. Dave Grohl, Pat Smear, Taylor Hawkins, and the rest of the gang were great at hyping up the crowd. Having simple conversation with the crowd and simply making everyone feel right at home. They also out preformed themselves playing cover songs like “Blitzkrieg Bop” by the Ramones, Van Halen’s “Jump”, Alice Cooper’s “Under my Wheels”, and “Under Pressure” by Queen. The Foo’s had a spectacular set list and made it feel more than just a Foo Fighters concert. The band had little surprises here and there throughout the show like Taylor Hawkins with a crazy drum solo that lasted for about 5 minutes! The opening act, The Struts, were also very great and played their hearts out. If you never been to a concert or never seen the Foo Fighters live, then you need to make sure you get out of your way to see these guys! They’re aboslute killers on stage! You won’t regret it! FYI if it’s an amphitheater venue it’s 10 times much better the crowd is way more fun and you can let loose and dance your ass off! ",
Foo Fighters,"Never seen Food before so was looking forward to Night 2. Arriving in Milton Keynes at 5pm I was hopeful of catching some of Royal Blood's set. However traffjc flow inbound was terrible and I lost 90 mins waiting on a dual carriageway in Milton Keynes on route to pre-booked parking at Stadium MK. When I finally parked the car there was a 20 min hike to the National Bowl. Sadly didn't see Royal Blood and missing the start of Iggy Pop - only hearing The Passenger & Lust for Life whilst on the inbound road Iggy Pop was good giving older Stooges song like No Fun, 1969 and Nightclubbing as well as solo hits like Real Wild Child. He still has it in spades Foos and Dave Grohl took to the stage a little early but the appreciative crowd were complaining. Dave was seated for the duration on a techno-throne looking like a dalek Davros-like base with Foos logo and a ton of flashing lights. His broken leg did not impact him in the slightest. He told stories that kept the crowd engaged. The other members of the band were very tight musically and showed this in solos throughout the night. Taylor Hawkins (the drummer) in particular shone - playing & singing Queen's We Will Rock You The ""Set"" was a run through of the Foo Fighters best of. The sound and light show was amazing. Now a Foos fan I would definitely see them again. Thanks ",
Foo Fighters,"I saw the Foo Fighters at Firefly 2014. The show Dave and the crew put on was easily the best show I have ever seen in my life. You will experience amazing music from every album featuring extended versions of almost every song. If the music isn't enough for you, the rock star atmosphere of the Foo Fighters will be. Chris Shiflett broke his ankle before the show and played in a chair with as much style as Nate Mendel and Pat Smear. If you know anything about Taylor Hawkins, you know he can rock the hell out of a drum set... he can also sing and did a great job at it too. If you're lucky enough, you might see the Foo Fighters transform into a bar band called 'The Holy Shits' that does covers of classic rock songs. For their 5 song encore (yup... 5) they played 'Schools Out' by Alice Cooper, 'Miss You' by The Rolling Stones, 'Aint Talkin Bout Love' by Van Halen, and 'Under Pressure' by Queen and Bowie followed by an amazing rendition of Everlong. If you appreciate rock music, or any music at all for that matter - go see the Foo Fighters. They're worth every penny and then some and you will remember it for the rest of your life. ",
Foo Fighters,"Love love love seeing the Foo Fighters. Avidly follow news to get tickets each time they come. So happy I got GA Standing this time as with such a big venue seating would have been wasted. However even though I was standing & got within 3 meters proximity of Dave Grohl, the venue (Etihad Stadium) is just too big.  With the roof closed (due to weather) the sound quality was ok, but not exceptionally loud. Next time I want to see them return to smaller venues with multiple dates. The podium stage did allow for many fans to get much closer than normal for some parts of the show & the screens were fantastic. As usual the Foos gave an awesome performance & best of all this time they did do material from every one of their 8 albums. I just wish the'd played more from the latest as thats probably the only time we'd hear those ones live.   A shame that although they played ""Outside"", Joe Walsh was otherwise engaged less than an hours drive away. But of course Dave did a superb job of the guitar solo. They are true entertainers & I can't wait until they release more material & come back to these shores again. ",
Foo Fighters,"What a-effing-mazing Foo Fighters Rock Show show at the Forum that was last night (9/21).  The band was fantastic, Dave is a lunatic, TH is not human, and Pat and the boys were spot on and totally entertaining.  Hits flowed one after the other in a fountain of awesomeness.  The crowd was thoroughly committed - I've never heard a crowd sing every last lyric, every ohhh and ahhhh.  It didnt hurt that we were on the floor at the rails - best ""seats"" I've ever had to a show.  While it was a cool concept to bring Stevie Nicks onstage with Haim (who are these girls, and why were they up there), it was a mash-up that failed to work for me.  Stevie looked frail, and her stumbling gait down the runway (did she hurt her leg or were her boots too heavy) was just painful to watch.  At least it was only 2 songs (i'd rather more Jack Black).  I love that Foo doesn't encore - they play till the cops kick them offstage - and you leave.  My ears are STILL ringing, and I can't get the refrain ""Something from Nothing"" out of my head and the smile off my face...  Thank you Foo Fighters and the Forum for a GREAT show. ",
Foo Fighters,"Not as good as their 2011 visit, but still an awesome gig by any other standard. The end of tour set, plus Dave's round the world trip for his daughter's dance, & the subsequent food poisoning clearly took a toil on his voice. Taylor's voice was also hardly there when he tried to sing. Still, they soldiered on like the true rock stars that they are, and rocked the stadium. Set design was a clear improvement, with the wide layout instead of the long & narrow, which meant that the seated tickets up the back line had a better view instead of the ""shitty seats"" from last time, especially with the raised sound desk blocking most of the view from their previous visit. The rising middle stage was a very welcome surprise, especially from the middle of the standing area. Not a big fan of all ages family crowds in the free standing area, with no concept of regular mosh etiquette. Might get seated tickets next time. Not a huge fan of their new material either, but am glad they kept them to the barest minimum. Also looks like Dave has settled on his signature guitar, & it looks & sounds absolutely amazing! ",
Foo Fighters,"They were amazing. I loved watching each member play. Taylor is such an incredible drummer. He never stops or let's up. Incredible! Dave too. They were so full of energy and love, it was a surreal night. They played to the audience. The spinning stage gave everyone a great perspective. It made me even appreciate seeing them from behind. And Dave's cracks about almost barfing were hilarious. I'd have to say they might be the hardest working band in the business. What an era for the foos and their fans. I can't get enough of them and those 'f-in' Foo Fighter songs. The guests were great especially for me tenacious D and Slash. I was happily surprised to see Paul Stanlely. Those two songs kicked a-s. Alice Cooper was great. I see why Dave and the Foos love and revere them. Dave and the whole could not have been more gracious. My favorite moment, 'There Goes My Hero' which Dave sang directly to Taylor. Great song, great band. And well deserved Taylor. You are my hero too. All you guys rock. ",
Foo Fighters,"Epic! I have seen this band more times than I care to admit without sounding like a stalker ;-) but as always they outdid themselves. Dave said to the people that have seen us before this is going to be the best one yet - and well it was. I loved that Chris and Taylor both sang - that Pat's song was Hey Ho during the band intros and Nate just kills it on the base! And it was great to see Rami fully installed in the band - Rami you sure can tinkle on that keyboard! Added bonus was 'Kiss Guy' - a young lad from the audience that came up on stage and performed with the band playing Monkey Wrench. Everyone was totally blown away by this young guys playing and watching Dave's face while he was running around the stage playing was just fantastic. And I called that they would start with Run - I almost passed out singing, air guitar'ing and head banging after the first track! Great gig - thanks Foo's I love yas!! xo ",
Foo Fighters,"Probabilmente il miglior concerto dell’anno!si vede che i Foo Fighters,nonostante suonino ormai da più di 20 anni ,si divertono ancora a suonare fra di loro trasmettendo la loro passione al pubblico.perchè il miglior concerto dell’anno? - hanno suonato due ore e mezza,praticamente tutti i singoli che hanno prodotto -quattro cover:blitzkrieg pop dei ramones,jump dei van halen (ma con la base di imagine di john Lennon),under pressure(con Dave Grohl alla batteria)..ma soprattutto it’s so easy dei guns con axl/slash/duff...momento pazzesco!canzone tiratissima! -continui sketch nel mezzo del concerto tipo”hey quanta gente,sembra un concerto dei Metallica!” Aspettando il bis poi di nuovo un siparietto nel dietro le quinte fra Dave Grohl,sua figlia e axl su quante canzoni dovevano fare ancora Si certo,il concerto costava molto,ma ne è valsa sicuramente la pena! ",
Foo Fighters,"You ever buy your tickets almost a full-year in advance? Yeah, me neither. Well, except this once. Prior to the last year (like.. the last 365 days), I hadn't ever seen the Foo play live.. and now I know better than to ever miss that opportunity again. I was turned onto these guys when I was like 11 or 12! (I'm 27 now.) They're still as rockin' as ever, and this was my third time seeing them over the past year. With special guests Bad Brains joining the guys towards the end of the set-- there was nothing that could slow these guys down. Dave still charismatic ever, sittin atop his broken-leg-throne.. Letting us know that dreams do come true, and that this whole Bad Brains thing was the coolest fuckin' thing he'd ever do. Large screens projecting for the cheap seats, my friend & I stood on the field and had a helluva time. These guys know how to put on a rock show. ",
Foo Fighters,"This is the second time I see the Foo Fighters live. First time happened in Lollapalooza Brazil two years ago and it was chaos (in a good way). All that energy, excitment and the opportunity to be so close to them was spectacular. This time I was a little bit calmer and I could enjoy the show more than last time. It's amazing to see those guys playing like if it was their last concert, with joy, powerful sound and loud guitars and strong drums. For those who haven't the opportunity to see them yet, my two cents, don't waste another minute!! You must to be there to feel the vibration, how Dave hypnotizes your mind and captivates your soul. I had seen many other concerts and I guarantee the Foo Fighters is one of the top bands out there. ",
Foo Fighters,"This concert will probably be legendary! They opened the concert with Everlong and during the second song, Monkey wrench, Dave Grohl breaks his f-cking leg!!! They stop the concert and the band explains that they will play some covers before they leave but after 15 min Dave comes back on stage and continues the concert sitting on a chair. With his broken leg! He keeps thanking us in the audience for staying and telling us he will never forget this concert, but if there is someone who should be thankful it is the 50.000 people at Ullevi Gothenburg who will forever be thankful for him follow through the whole concert! And none of us will ever forget this concert! Foo Fighters and Dave Grohl are my heroes! ",
Foo Fighters,"To repeat David Grohls comment at the en of the consert: Shit happens, but this takes the cake. David Grohl fell of the stage and broke his leg after the first song Everlong. The craziest and worst openings I have ever seen. Dave told the audience he was sorry and that the Foo Fighters will come back and play later. The band continued to play cover versions of David Bowie, Queen classics, when the drummer Taylor Hawkins annonced the audience not to leave the arena. Dave Grohl is on it's way back on stage after fixing his broken leg. Then Dave came back in a wheel chair and continued the consert with his leg in bandage. The weirdest show I have ever seen. ",
Foo Fighters,"7/25/18 concert at Blossom Music Center in Ohio was an awesome show!!!  From the opening act -The Struts, to the FF, the music was spectacular.  Dave is a showman for sure and he engaged the audience throughout the night! Dave's energy was on spot throughout the 2-1/2 hour show.  Bummed it didn't go the three hours like the show in Fresno, CA, but Blossom is an outdoor venue and there are ordinances. The only drawback was Dave's ""screaming.""  There was reverb from the mic and the lyrics were distorted as the mic setting was a bit loud. If you get a chance to see this venue near you, GO - you won't be sorry. ",
Foo Fighters,"Currently, perhaps, the hardest working act in Rock and roll! Of course, Grohl will remind the audience of that throughout the show :""we're gonna play for 4 f***ing hours!"". Well, they didn't make 4 hours, which might be a good thing- I was deaf and hoarse for the next day trying to sing/scream with Grohl. How does he do it for a whole tour??!!  Great crowd with a good mix of young and old-FF have a wide appeal. Haven't been to a rock and roll concert this good since... well... last April with Tom Petty in Atlanta :(  RIP Tom! The Struts opened and they were great energetic rock- good compliment to FF! ",
Foo Fighters,"I've been to a gazillion shows in my lifetime, but this was definitely one of the absolute BEST! 3 hours of nearly nonstop music! Dave also brought a hometown college student on stage that had been holding up a sign all night asking him to let him play the drums on Pressure. The band amazingly performed the Queen/David Bowie song to the delight of the audience, and the kid NAILED his part on the drums that Taylor gave up to do vocals for the song! My only regret is that I can't go back and live this night over!!! We travelled 4 hours to see the show. I'd travel 10 more to see another one!!!! ",
Alicia Keys,"Alicia keys is soulful and sensational, she can get the crowd on their feet and she can also get them sat down listening as she hits every note perfectly as she hammers out her beautiful ballads.    You may think you don't know many of her songs but tune after tune you scream "" I know this song"".  As much as she is a soulful singer she can also play the piano thrashing them keys to make the songs come alive and wow does she make a party swing.    We all have our favourite songs but mine has got to be ""one"" although not accompanied by U2 it still sounds awesome with her backing singers.  Her dancers are hot and sassy and that is just the men but she has fun with her dancers and although not one to chat for ever during her set she does interact with the crowd. Towards the end of her set when she sang Empire State of mind / New York the roof lifted ...    So tickets were reasonable priced, the set was long and the quality of the artist was spot on.... Don't miss out next time Alicia tours - you won't be disappointed. ",
Alicia Keys,The show was amazing there are no words that can describe how incredible she is as an artist and a human being. She puts her heart and soul in every note she plays and sings. Truly humble and inspiring. Love her! ,
OneRepublic,"One Republic is such a great band! At Stadthalle here in Vienna, Ryan Tedder was the living proof that a tight touring schedule is BAD FOR YOU. He was clearly nursing a bad cold and spent the entire concert croaking his way through each song, running out of breath. Hitting the right notes was an exercise in semi-happy accidents and the more frustrated he got, the worse things were.    From the beginning it was clear that the entire band would rather be anywhere else than on stage. Uninspired, tired and - almost in an effort to convince themselves - Ryan regurgitated the touring-phrases ""Vienna - we love you!"" and ""Vienna is one of our top-five favourite places to play!"" (replace ""Vienna"" with a city of your choice) with little conviction.    They tried. Oh, they tried, but as the show went on, I only felt sorry for them, wishing them a long holiday in the Bahamas.    Heavy touring is not for this band. If you wish to see them, make sure to catch them early on and preferably only after they have had at least a full week with no appearances anywhere else.    And Ryan - please get some singing lessons to help you protect your voice in these conditions. There are techniques, you know. Singing should not sound laboured. 15 November 2014 you went far beyond laboured with your singing. ""It's a wonderful world""? Not for a voice that is crying out for a rest. ",
OneRepublic,"One Republic was literally incredible - I was lucky enough to be right at the front, and it was so exhilarating. They started with a white sheet in front of the stage so no one could see what was going on, and when they started, all the lights went out except for one spotlight which lit up the silhouette of Ryan - who sang Light It Up a capella, until he reached the chorus when the music kicked in, the sheet dropped and all the lights came on, it was incredible. You don't have to be massive fan to enjoy yourself, you'll find you know the words to at least a few of their songs, like Apologise, Good Life and Counting Stars. They cover all sorts, from the old ones everyone knows to the new ones which are just incredible, as well as a couple of really good covers which are often an improvised one off. If you are a fan of Imagine Dragons, Coldplay or anyone else similar then you will enjoy yourself at One Republic immensely. Not only do they put on an incredible show, with light up pianos, projector screens showing various clips, lightbulbs hanging from the ceiling, tonnes of confetti and incredible live music, you can't take your eyes of Ryan because his stage presence and talent is immense. Can't recommend these enough - no matter how much or how little you like them beforehand, you will come away a fan, guaranteed. ",
OneRepublic,"It's time to re-evaluate your priorities. Seeing OneRepublic live in concert should be at the top of your bucket list! Ryan Tedder and his band are well known for winning over music listeners through the radio waves, but I promise seeing them in concert is an exciting experience you'll have to see to believe. Known for talkable lyrics, and incredible musical organization, OneRepublic will keep you dancing, singing, and moving for years after their memorable concerts. Ryan likes to throw in some acoustic sets, and I often find that each concert has a variety of popular hits arranged for an acoustic gathering. He also likes to treat his audiences to covers because, as he recently put it, ""I like to sing lyrics that I wished I wrote myself."" You'll get to hear the story behind the music and be treated to a wide range of stunning vocals. See OneRepublic live and soon you'll be counting stars! ",
OneRepublic,"OneRepublic is a great band and they showed this with a steady stream of their hits.  Faves of the night included 'What You Wanted' and 'Secrets'.  The ""coffee shop"" / small-band segment was really interesting and highlighted the tight playing of the group.  Lead singer Ryan Tedder engaged the audience continually and made many references to the city and the Calgary Flames (hockey team) which, predictably, got the crowd excited.  The covers were excellent and fun - 'Apologize' / 'Stay With Me' (Sam Smith); 'Budapest' (George Ezra); and, 'What a Wonderful World' (Louis Armstrong).  An awesome night. Also - I had heard that 'Kongos' had been opening for OneRepublic earlier in the tour and was totally bummed they weren't opening here but 'Lights' was really good.  She really got the crowd going and has a great energy. ",
OneRepublic,"OneRepublic won my heart with some silly commentary. (""This is our second show of the tour. So when - not if, when - something goes wrong, please forgive us."" ""If you know the words, sing them. Because I will probably forget them."" ""I promised I'd never sing these songs I wrote because they weren't for OneRepublic. But it's been ten years, and I don't care about being cool, so let's do it. Cool is relative."") I was also especially happy to hear their cover of James Arthur's ""Say You Won't Let Go"" when James couldn't perform due to sickness. Overall, OneRepublic really related to me an individual level rather than as an all-star mega-huge performing band, and I appreciated that authenticity and silliness. ",
OneRepublic,"It was a very nice concert, but nothing more special than the album songs,,,, I had expected some more life entertainment, more show and disappointing was the performance of "" if love runs out "". A lot of people left already before this song... I had the pleasure, I thought it would be a pleasure, to enter through VIP Premium, car near tot the Burg and drinks and food.. but to my disappointment, all te places to see the boys were occupied, and it was quit a distance to see them.. so I had to walk down, which was not a pleasure. Also the public was very quit and not interacting with the group. So very reserved... I  had expect more life! The performance was good, maybe to good to be a life concert... ",
OneRepublic,"Oh my gosh! I waited 5 years to see OneRepublic live and wow was it worth the wait! These guys are absolutely amazing and sound even better live than they do on their CDs (if that’s even possible)! Ryan puts on such an amazing performance and whilst you are stood there at the end completely out of breath, with a sore throat and sweating, he’s still bouncing around on stage and giving it his all. The energy Ryan brings to the stage is unreal- he’s dancing to every song and still singing perfectly. These guys put on one of the best performances I’ve ever seen so if you are going to see anyone live in concert, make it these guys!! ",
OneRepublic,"We are devout fans of OneRepublic for years now. This was our 6th concert following them from California, to CO, NY, and OK. We paid enormous prices to be able to sit in the front row. OneRepublic never disappoints, however, compared to their other concerts, we were saddened that there were no encores, almost felt their performance was ""phoned in"". Seems like they are becoming more and more detached from their fans, not very interactive anymore. Almost robotic. In light of his recent struggles, it seems they can't shake the ""burn out"" from so much touring. Praying that changes and doesn't leave a bad stain on their career. ",
OneRepublic,"Onerepublic gave an AMAZING concert. There are very few artists who can do what they did. Onerepublic took many of their own songs, played them in a completely different way (""Come Home"" on guitar, ""Good Life"" as an edm-ish version), and they still sounded incredible, and the room full of singing fans definitely approved. Nearly every person there was on their feet for the entire concert- it was that energetic. Even some odd number of days later I still can't stop talking about this concert and how talented Onerepublic is. I already knew they were a great band but this really comfirmed that. ",
OneRepublic,"They were so good.    The first part was assured by Kongos, a group of South Africans I had never heard of but they played really great songs. Punchy and original. OneRepublic had so much presence on stage, the musicians and frontman were rocking it.   Plus, they did a really great job in terms of lighting, there was some kind of game lights, it changed depending on the song.    I believe everything was thought.    So beyond a concert, it' musical art.    Absolutly loved it.    (And trust me NO PLAYBLACK, these guys CAN SING) ",
OneRepublic,"Onerepublic, I love you guys. Such a great concert and they sound incredible live. Played mostly songs from their album ""Native"" but also played some older songs as well such as ""Stop and Stare"", ""Apologize"" and ""Secrets"". My friend and I were dancing the whole time having way too much fun :)    American Authors and The Script played before and they were incredible as well! Great stage presence and I officially have the biggest crush on the lead singer from The Script now (Irish, adorable, passionate? check check check). ",
OneRepublic,"I loved this concert so much! This was my first concert and they sound just the same as their songs in real life. The energy was great and everyone was clapping, dancing, and singing altogether. The opening acts and guest singer/ band was great! I loved Fitz and the Tantrums and James Arthur so much. One thing that was a con was the fact that One Republic came out a little late and the opening acts seem like they were on stage longer than One Republic. Overall, I would rate this concert 11/10! ",
OneRepublic,From the opening song to the very up-beat encore OneRepublic literally set my heart on fire with their highly energetic songs to their sad songs. They had the whole crowd singing along and me screaming the lyrics passionately. I had the best time of my life last night and even though we were in the middle of a lightning storm I was to engrossed in the music to care. I would go back and relive it in a heartbeat! 10\10 best concert of my life so far. ,
OneRepublic,"One Republic performance was beyond my expectation. The weather was good and shiny before they came to the stage when Script band was performing that added additional flavour to music.  The repertoire, artists perform was incredible with all those light effects…  It was memorable experience and I will remember it forever, it’s one in lifetime experience..  I wish they will visit Toronto again and I will be closer to the stage next time! ",
OneRepublic,"Awesome concert!  So much energy. =D Fitz and the Tantrums were also great.  Would definitely go see them again the next time they are in town.  I'm not sure why the word limit on this review is minimum 30 words, I don't know what else to write?  I guess the seats were comfortable, as comfortable as they could be for being your standard plastic stadium seats.  But we were standing most of the time, so it didn't matter... ",
OneRepublic,"I had an absolutely amazing time! The song selections, lighting, and everything was perfect. My only request would've been that they played A.I.. But I understand the night is short and if they could they would play every song for us. All in all, definitely one of my favorite concerts I've been to yet. Their songs are so special and unique. It was a pleasure sharing the night with onerepublic. <3 ",
OneRepublic,"First off, I have to commend The Script and American Authors for great shows. Danny from The Script was upbeat, ran through the crowd, and made the crowd laugh.    OneRepublic was, to put it simply, amazing. Ryan was energetic and fantastic live, as well as the rest of the band. They utilized several different instruments and lights to add a different dimension. All around a great show. ",
OneRepublic,"BEST CONCERT EVER!! Opening acts James Alexander and Fitz and The Tantrums were really catchy and fun. OneRepublic was incredible! The visuals were amazing. The band played all their hits. Ryan Tedder came out to the crowd and sang ""If I Lose Myself"" and sang songs that he wrote for other artists including ""Halo"" and ""Rumor Has It"". One of the best shows I've ever been to. ",
OneRepublic,OneRepublic is absolutely amazing I've seen them in Concert twice already and they were both the best Concerts ever! OneRepublic is my all-time favorite Band there seriously absolutely amazing! I'm hoping to see them in Concert again this summer actually! Ryan Tedder and the rest of the OneRepublic Band are all seriously absolutely amazing! ,
Miley Cyrus,"Well known for her questionable attire and twerking, going to a live performance by Miley Cyrus is going to be wild…no question about it. Whether she’s prancing around the stage in something resembling her underwear, or sticking her tongue out in her trademark style, no two Cyrus shows are the same. Her extreme teen  pop vibe, however much bad press it receives,  has launched her to fame and success. If you think the likes of Rhianna’s shows are full of energy, Miley Cyrus’ is doubled, if not tripled. You wonder where she gets it from, but upon looking closer, it materialises that she in fact trains pretty hard alongside her dancers. Ultimately, she loves to put on a good show with outrageous costumes, special effects, and set, which are visually astounding. She always makes sure to play her most well known songs, and it was fantastic when she sang ‘The Climb’, reminding the audience how she started out as Hannah Montanna star. Wow has she come a long way! Just fantastic. ",
Miley Cyrus,"Miley Cyrus concerts' is always fantastisk. No doubt there. http://boligadvokatodense.dk. Her voice, and the show - thats a fantastic match. Hope she is coming to Denmark within the next couple of years. ",

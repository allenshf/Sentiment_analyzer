Rihanna,"Rihanna made her entrance through one of the tunnels like a boxer coming out for the main event. Concealing her face under a heavy hood, she slowly found her way onto the platform opposite the stage. A spotlight followed her every move, making the white robe glow, while phone lights provided stars to pierce through the dark night surrounding her. A single microphone waited on a stand as thunderous applause and ear-piercing screams filled the venue, and it served to silence the crowd in an instant. “All along it was a fever, a cold sweat hot-headed believer…” Having exposed nothing more than her unmistakable voice (and fingernails and unmistakable ass) to her audience, there was no doubt as to who was hiding under that robe. The entirety of “Stay” was performed from that position, before she revealed her face. Having attended close to a thousand concerts, it’s not often I find myself in awe at being in close proximity to a musician, but seeing Rihanna standing in front of me, in the flesh, made me realize what a cult of personality she has built around herself. As she continued the performance with “Love the Way You Lie (Part II)”, she was part pop diva, part rock star, part sex symbol, all while never being anything but Rihanna. She is still so young, yet has already solidified herself among the very few people in history who everyone will know by a single name. It was very in the show, but I was already convinced she had earned that status as well. Her voice is her defining talent, but her business acumen, stage presence, attitude, and beauty are what complete the package. - See more at: http://ilistensoyoudonthaveto.com/2016/05/10/rihanna-viejas-arena-05-09-16/#sthash.AluW51yF.dpuf ",1
Rihanna,"It was said that the entrance was at 5 p.m., but we were only in the stadium at around 7 p.m. and the music was already playing. Outside everyone was getting nervous. Only when we got to the front did we read on a poster that The Weekend was not going to come at all. It's a shame that there was no information about it on the INTERNET! We were all in line, around 4 p.m. And we had to watch each other the whole time as crowds of people just walk past us and push their way forward. And none of the security staff did anything about it. We have received e-mails saying that there will be stricter controls and that we should therefore plan more time, but where were the staff for this and to be honest it was a very poor control and still it took forever! When we finally got inside we didn't even know where to go because there was simply nothing signposted. Big Sean was really in the mood. He was there for an hour. After that there was only one playlist and we waited over an hour for Rihanna. When she finally came, the back and foot pain were forgotten from all standing and waiting. She gave us one great show offered. I love her and the comments on the internet that she was listless is just not true. The show only lasted 90 minutes and we would have all been happy about an encore, but it was still a great concert!",0
Rihanna,"With all that has happened in France recently, Rihanna faced a stiff challenge getting Parisians and herself in a summery party mood at the Stadt De France. However, she seemed to instinctively make the right choices to tap into the crowds fears, their need to reflect and their right to sing and dance without care. Rihanna opened the show hidden beneath a white hooded sweater and sang the wistful 'Stay' - a song whose lyrics took on a lot of ambivalence given the current political climate. The songs from her Anti album were well received even though their lazy, sexy groove is more suited to a more intimate arena. Among the many hits from the album, 'Desperado' and 'Kiss it Better' stood out as they showcased Rihanna's scything vocals and Prince-like funk. Rihanna also expertly mixed in medleys of favourites such as 'Umbrella', 'Man Down' and 'We Found Love in a Hopeless Place.' An undoubted highlight was 'Diamonds' which was introduced with a genuinely heartfelt speech by Rihanna expressing support for peace and the people of France. She then asked for the stadium to send out its light to France by way of illuminated mobile phones and the result was a spectacular touching moment. By the end of the show, everyone had fallen more in love with Rihanna and headed back into the dark Parisian night with a little more light in their hearts and minds. ",1
Rihanna,"You've seen her music videos. You follow her on twitter. You follow her style, trends, favorites. You sing the lyrics in the shower, driving home with your friends, serenading a lover. But nothing is as real as seeing Rihanna perform live!!!  The energy from the audience, the attitude and power that's thrown back off the stage...ah-maz-ing.   The peeks and valleys from the soulful serenade of Stay to the sexy shock of S&M it's all new once you hear it live!  One of my favorite things about going to a show is not only the excitement building up to it, buying the tickets then getting my bracelet and going in. That's just the beginning. I love more than anything, after seeing a great show and I'm back at home listening to the music, remembering where I was, who I was with, how I felt, what I saw and how much fun we were having when we were rocking out and suddenly, Rihanna isn't just some celebrity entertainer, she is a part of something bigger and the music is suddenly different, better, more meaningful.   I've seen Rihanna a couple of times and every time that girl delivers. Her fans love her, she has attitude and swag that makes her real and sometimes the energy leaves you glowing for days and asking yourself, how long do I have to wait until music makes me feel this high again? ",1
Rihanna,"It was a great concert from the begining. DJ Mustard started the show, and it was wery good warm up, people were dancing. Then after a little break came on the stage Big Sean. That was also powerful performance and we really enjoyed that. After another break started Rihanna's show. She came from the back of the arena to the little stage above the soundmen. Two slow songs were awesome. Than she walked on steel and glass bridge and sing a song Woo and another one above us. See was so close to us, that was perfect. Then the reast of the show was on the main stage. She sings wery well, but the sound was overbassed, and the singing can't be heared clearly, that was mistake. Also she was'n talk much, she gave us one song after another. But the songs are so great. It was generally songs from the new album Anti, great. The show duration was 90min. I'm so blessed that I was on the show. I was great. Thank you and hopefully see you RiRi again soon. ",1
Rihanna,"Rihanna's Anti World tour concert in Malmö was even better than I expected. I have to be honest, I was not a big fan of hers but of course Queen Riri changed that with her beautiful yet slaying personality and amazing voice. The overall experience was fun althought the only thing that was a littlee annoying is the fact that the concert started a little more than an hour later than what it was supposed to. But I mean.. it's Rihanna, she can do whatever. A tips from me would be to either buy the standing tickets as close to the scene as possible or buy the ones that are high up and on the opposite side of the scene. I was up and although it was long away from Riri it was magical to see all the people and the lights and literary everything. If you're hesirating weather you should go or not I would tell you to go go go, because it is such a beautiful and fun experience to have! ",1
Rihanna,"In one word - unforgettable. Rihanna was in rare form. This tour has a more subdued palette than her other tours, as the stage was a blank white, and all of her outfits were in shades of cream, tan, black, and brown. However, there was a special energy in the room that night. Rihanna seemed happy, comfortable, and more in control than she has ever been. She joked with the crowd, engaged with all sides of the arena, and made sure everyone had a good time. Halfway during the concert, she announced that it was party time, and the stage lit up with these cool colored pods that pulsated in different colors. Other highlights include her flying over the audience, a foam machine on stage, and her dancers exciting the crowd in sparkly outfits. I envy those who are going to see her, and implore those who can still buy tickets to do so! ",1
Rihanna,"Rihanna is probably one of the best pop artists at the moment. I've gone to three shows - first in Portugal, in her ""Loud"" tour; 2nd in London in a small venue for her ""777"" tour; and the last one in Richmond park, as part of the ""Unapolagetic"" tour.    All of them were incredibly amazing! Her songs put so much energy in the crowd and it's impossible to not get stuck to her dance moves and stage special effects. From the lights, sceneries, to the outfits - everything is top quality and very sophisticated and original. You are able to listen to the top hits, and also some medleys from her older stuff. Setlists are wisely chosen, as they keep the crowd excited along the show. I would definitely go to her next show - it's always a surprise and somewhat different from what she has done until now. She rocks! ",1
Rihanna,"Daaaammmn. I didn't know what to expect, especially since I found myself more excited for the preshow of 'the weeknd'to the Rhianna tour and contemplated selling the tickets after he and Travis Scott pulled out. I'm glad I didn't. The show itself made me realise just how many anthems Rhianna has to her name.These sprinkled throwbacks were the most memorable for me throughout the show. The set and lighting combined to give a fab production value over all, in particular the very beginning where Rihanna emerged from behind and took a smaller stage before flying off on a clear platform across to the main stage. Overall I really really enjoyed the show. Wasn't quite one that made me jump and wave my arms around, but one that made me appreciate the talent Rihanna clearly has. ",0
Rihanna,"Grate show! Would definitely go see Rihanna live again! Enjoyed everything - signing, visuals, dancing, costumes! Really recommend to watch Rihanna live performance at least once! A bit long show due to 2 artists performing before Rihanna and also a bit too long time waiting for her to get on the stage. Not nice, especially for people standing all that super long time in VIP zone and Golden Circle without possibility to leave in between and not loose their position closer to stage. Can imagine it was very tough to stand more than three hours in a raw. Had standing ticket myself and must say it was a bit hard. Other than that - the Rihanna's performance was worth every bit of waiting! Loved her! ",0
Rihanna,"An amazing experience as one would expect but even though I'm a huge Rihanna's fan you could tell that she became too ""big"" so I didn't feel that connection with the fans even though she was waving to everyone but it didn't feel genuine. At one direction concert for example I felt more interaction from one of the members Liam even though my sister is a bigger fan then I am. I feel like I was born too late lol she's a goddess but the concerts are not like they were in the 80's  or 90's. Overall she proved to me talented and more beautiful than on TV but I will remember her and not the concert so much. ",-1
Rihanna,"Incredibly powerful show, red hot, amazing dancers and acrobats, spectacular costumes, fantastic sound and light but most of all flawless vocals by Rihanna and her backing singers, loved the song choices and have been hooked on the Anti album ever since!! Finally the show was a visual sensation, what the whole theme seemingly inspired by dessert troopers / safari chic explorers / inter galactic space oddity head pieces and hoods plus a whole load of shimmer and sequins! ",1
Rihanna,It was a great fucking show I loved it so much. She is my second favorite female singer second only to Lana Del Rey. Her energy and presence and love for buffalo was present and everyone in the crowd felt it. The only negatives I can think of is that she only sung tidbits of a few songs which made the concert much shorter than necessary also there were remixes on her classics when she should have just stuck with the original beat. 4.5/5 for me. ,1
Rihanna,"Too short, I think people pay a lot of money just for see her and she was late, 20:50 (supposly 20:30) she left at 22:20 (ten minutes before the hour) she spend too much time in the backstage changing her clothes and she didn't finish any song, just Diamond. So I had fun, I sang a lot but is definitely not what we were expecting, bit dissapointed. The staff was really nice. Sorry for my english, I'm not british. ",-1
Rihanna,"Now, I'm not a massive Rihanna fan, but I went because it was my friends birthday. She was lip syncing most of it, and half the time she was changing cloths, allowing her backing singers to fill in  the rest of it. I would expect someone of her popularity to give her fans, her legit voice. I can only really see Diamonds as the one time she sang properly, so that was a genuine stand out. ",-1
Rihanna,"Amazing. So many throwbacks. I really liked the Anti album, but I was also glad that she performed her line in songs like ""Take Care"" ""Run This Town"" ""Love the Way You Lie"", & she did throwbacks like ""Man Down"", ""Umbrella"", and even songs that weren't on her album like ""FourFive Seconds"". Performance is amazing, and her stage presence was ethereal. 10/10 would recommend. ",1
Rihanna,"Love Rihanna and it was great seeing her, however, the Anti World Tour is really mellow/moody and not so much exciting/mind-blowing. The show seemed really fast and it probably didn't help my experience that the girl next to me was hammered and falling into me every minute. Overall, it could've been watched on youtube for a better experience. ",-1
Rihanna,Hands down one of the best concerts I've been to in a very long time. She interacted with her fans. She entered from the back so all her fans that were far from the stage got to see her up close. She even brought out surprise guest Drake and he did a couple songs. Truly amazing night. Great show I would definitely see Rihanna again ,1
Rihanna,"Oh na na, that's her name!   I have been to see Rihanna live many times and each time I have been pleasantly suprised. She compeltely owns the stage and puts on an amazing show!  She spends time with the crowd, interacting and does a well rehearsed show of all her greatest hits. Highly recommended! ",1
Rihanna,"Hello Beautiful Queen Rihanna, when are coming back to Detroit, Michigan for a concert and turn it out? You are a great performer and a fabulous singer. I love your style. Can't wait to see you. Love all of your music. Continue your Legacy. Hope to  see you soon my Queen. ",0
Coldplay,"I had always heard Coldplay were a fantastic band to see live. They did not disappoint last night at Fedex Field, right in the midst of their joyous and decidedly over-the-top Head Full of Dreams tour. The show began with an explosion of color and light (including the LED wristbands supplied to every concertgoer) in the titular track on the band's touring album. Then came fan-favorite ""Yellow,"" followed by ""Every Teardrop is a Waterfall,"" the ever-popular ""The Scientist,"" and ""Birds"" (the latter was a bit of a personal disappointment as it replaced the brilliant ""God Put a Smile Upon Your Face"" from recent setlists). This part of the show finished with the anthem ""Paradise,"" featuring an incredible remix outro. Next the show slowed down for an intimate trio of songs (most of us actually took a seat). This included one of the better tracks from the sub-par ""Ghost Stories"", ""Magic."" Soon, however, things picked up with the timeless piano strokes of ""Clocks,"" themed to a magical red light show. Next came the lighthearted ""Charlie Brown."" Before it began, lead singer Chris Martin asked everyone to put away their phones and simply enjoy the show. This was followed by the radio hit ""Hymn for the Weekend,"" a candlelit (okay...Iphone flashlight lit) ""Fix You,"" and ""Viva la Vida."" This last one was remarkable, as nearly the entire stadium knew the lyrics and sang along to the triumphant ""Oh-oh-ohhhh"" chant. The groovy ""Adventure of a Lifetime"" finished off this section, featuring Chris gettin' down with the audience, asking everyone to ""Get low!"" Then came the highlight of the night for me: an acoustic quad of older (*cough* better *cough*) Coldplay songs which were as intimate as they were nostalgic. The lovely riffs of ""In my Place"" started off the set. ""Don't Panic"" was sung by drummer Will Champion; it's one of my favorites. But it couldn't top what was (for me) the best song of the night: ""Trouble."" Somber but beautiful in its own way, ""Trouble"" is a rare find in the setlists of today's Coldplay and was absolutely fantastic. Finally came another rare gem: ""Green Eyes,"" which was somewhat marred by Chris's well-intentioned attempt at giving the local Redskins some luck (HA! what folly) by changing the lyrics. The finale of the show was the hopeful and popular trio of ""Something Just like This,"" ""A Sky Full of Stars,"" and ""Up and Up."" This last track was played against the backdrop of the magical and visually stunning music video for the song. And if there were two adjectives to sum up the show as a whole, they would be just that: magical and visually stunning. Thanks for an awesome show, Coldplay! ",1
Coldplay,"If you're wondering what to expect from Coldplay, expect the best show of your life!  This was my first time seeing Coldplay at the Royal Albert Hall in London and I have to say this was one of best nights of my life. No exaggeration. They performed many of their most popular classics such as ""Fix you"" and ""The Scientist"" and pretty much all of my favourites ""Charlie Brown"" and ""Every Teardrop is a Waterfall"" including new tracks from their latest album, Ghost Stories.   The atmosphere was incredible; I've never experienced anything like it in comparison. You just had to be there! Coldplay had you dancing out of your seats for their upbeat tracks such as ""Sky Full Of Stars"" and hearing their more mellow tracks like ""True Love"" was just simply beautiful and enchanting. Their playlist for the night was definitely on point and well connected with the crowd and us fans. The stage was right in the center so I'm pretty sure everyone had a great view, it was all set up very well and the lighting looked brilliant.  And as for my most memorable experience? The whole gig! There was a point at the end of ""God Put a Smile Upon Your Face"" when Chris Martin literally threw his electric guitar in the air and let it smash the floor for an epic finish, everyone went crazy!!! Coldplay has been a strong British iconic band for many years now, they know how to put on a show and they honestly do give it their all.   Me and my friend are proud to say that we was there that night, last thing I have to say is that if you ever get the chance to see Coldplay live, grab your tickets and grab them quick!   I promise you, you won't be disappointed in the slightest.  Prepare to be blown away! ",1
Coldplay,"This was my second time seeing Coldplay, and both times were amazing. The song choice was great, with a mix of classic hits (""Yellow"", ""The Scientist"", ""Viva la Vida"", ""Paradise""( old favourites (""Til Kingdom Come"", and ""Shiver"" being played upon request), and newer, more high energy songs off ""A Head Full of Dreams"". The Xylobands were a hit again, really making a spectacular light show along with various other effects, and colourful balloons being released into the crowd. The whole audience was just so full of energy thanks to the band's performance. Since it was raining heavily, the roof had to be covered, which meant no fireworks, but the band still delivered an amazing show despite this. Frontman Chris Martin always creates a great atmosphere, with enthusiasm and positivity, like carrying the country's flag in his back pocket, and apologising for the fact that, as he put it, ""Britain did something pretty stupid last week..."" and just generally making the crowd feel great with humour and honesty. All of the band members just look really comfortable with each other and deliver a really great performance together. Tributes were very nicely and elegantly paid to Muhammad Ali and David Bowie, and the final song, ""Up & Up"", ended the concert on a really positive note, and I would definitely recommend Coldplay to anyone who has the chance to see them play live. ",1
Coldplay,"There is little in this world that compares to a Coldplay concert. Exhilarating, energetic and euphoric are just some of the words that can be used to describe what one experiences when Chris Martin and band take to the stage. One of my most memorable concert experiences ever, when Coldplay played the Emirates Stadium back in 2012, it was simply astounding. Extravagant production and simply phenomenal live music, it became clear to me why tickets for these shows trade hands for thousands and why fans travel far and wide. Hearing 60,000 people sing word for word hit singles such as Paradise, Fix You and Princess of China made the hairs on my arms stand on end, so one can only imagine how this must feel for the band. Their track record speaks for itself. Eight Brit Awards, seven Grammys, six number one albums and 60 million record sales make Coldplay’s success undeniable and they continue to reign as one of the world’s biggest bands. The reason behind this success becomes clear at a live show. As a live act, Coldplay have achieved things that others have not. They are truly in a league of their own and this can only be understood when you witness this for yourself. I have tried but my words simply cannot capture the magic. ",1
Coldplay,"First of all I need to just say wow! Wow! Yesterday I experienced one of the greatest nights of my life. Yesterday I really did feel like I was part of something special, something so big and beautiful. The love, the happiness and the excaitment people were feeling last night were something you can't put words on.  We stood in the rain for so many hours, we sat in a que and then we stood in the rain again.. but let me just say that when Coldplay came on stage they put on the best god damn show ever. You could really feel their thankfulness during the show. They promised us (in Chris Martins own words) ""The best fucking show ever"" and let me tell you it was! During the night I got to experience people from different countries dancing and singing along together, I got to experience that moment when Chris decided to write a new song about Sweden and Gothenburg! The night was amazing in so many ways. And just as he said during the night, that he believes when people are working together and last night everybody in that arena stood together. We celebrated the music, the evening and most of all we celebrated the love. Because in the end of the day Love is what matters and it will always win. Yesterday was beautiful, just pure beautiful! ",1
Coldplay,"Since the release of Coldplay's fifth album 'Mylo Xyloto' the emphasis of their live show appears to be on the theatrics and the avant-garde. An album so super charged with power pop it was considered a substitute to red bull, the band quickly substituted the tender subtleties of 'Shivers' for the brass tones of 'Charlie Brown' and 'Hurts Like Heaven'. These new tracks are undoubtedly anthemic yet the visual displays and complexing stage layouts slightly detract from the musicianship of the quartet. Whilst performing the more downtempo and emotive tracks from break up album 'Ghost Stories' Chris Martin's vocal sounds notably weak during 'Magic' and all of the pyro-techniques and visuals cannot hide this. They recover with some classics including 'The Scientist' which is sang back in force by the crowds and the flawless 'Every Teardrop is A Waterfall' closes the main set in a suitably euphoric manner. However the choice to return with the floundering and flat 'anthem' 'Sky Full of Stars' which Chris consistently fails to deliver vocally seems a poor way to close a tour from one of the world's most esteemed pop/rock bands. It leaves the audiences wondering if 'Mylo Xyloto' was a particular career pinnacle for the band. ",0
Coldplay,"A Coldplay concert is a real face to face experience for a someone who love their songs. It may not be an intimate experience but considering the legions of fans that they have only a concert can accommodate everyone who are waiting all their lives for a chance to hear them live. and they never disappoint. A total performance complete with lasers and light and firework BUT without much fanfare, just them singing & playing their hearts OUT song after song alone or in harmony with the fans some crying, most gleefully dancing to their upbeat song or swaying OR slow dancing to slow Fix You or Yellow and probably thinking of someone they ""cannot replace"". Chris Martin is an awesome guy and so are the rest of the band. May their personal lives be as awesome as their professional lives, they deserve that too. as to Singapore, it may not be as engaging as it would be in the Philippines but hey, no one can complain; i had the best time celebrating my birthday in one of the best stadium this side of town with around 50K Coldpay fans celebrating with me :) :). Long live Coldplay, may you continue to bring joy to you fans worldwide. Looking forward to another Coldplay concert experience in the future. lsM/cebu/ ",1
Coldplay,"Most AMAZING show I've EVER seen. I've seen some legends. The Who, BB King, Depeche Mode five times, the Cute, Social Distortion, Blue October, many, many more. Coldplay blew them ALL away by far, and I even had crappy seats. I see them again in Philly in August, and I'm counting down the days! Fireworks! The bracelets lit up and changed colors with the stage lighting. Michael J Fox made a special guest appearance playing ""Earth Angel"" and ""Johnny B Good"" with the band. He was spectacular!! The show lasted just over two hours, but it felt like it had just started. Chris Martin may very well be the greatest front man of all time. He can work a crowd, even the stuffed shirts, like nobody's business. Coldplay is my favorite band for a reason, only a few of them listed above. They're all classically trained musicians. All of them multi-instrumentalists. Songs range from ballads to get up on your feet and jump around beats! AMAZING show, AMAZING band! I love you Guy, Jonny, Will, and Chris. Please keep doing what you're doing. ",1
Coldplay,"Piece of para paraa paradise in Berlin!!! It was one of the best shows in my life (if it comes to visual effects), all of these confetti, colourful  powders in the air, and big baloons! One big WOW.  Chris and his band were so joyful, funny and relaxed. I always thought he has a nice voice, nothing spectacular, just ""quite normal voice"". That's my opinion. And after the show I'm not going to change that. Instruments were great, his voice was cool, that's it. But songs were just awesome, I loved that! Especially the older ones like Paradise, The Scientist, Princess of China (ft. Rihanna, I was sooo happy to hear that song!), Fix you, etc. Of course there were many occasions to dance when you heard Hymn for The Weekend (AMAZING, with additional techno(?)dance remixes), Adventure of a lifetime, viva la vida or sky full of stars. My rate from 1 to 5 is 4+. Great atmosphere, great people, I had fun and I definitely want to see Coldplay again! :) ",1
Coldplay,"Coldplay. What can I say? They are masters of the stadium experience. The fireworks and the LED wrist bands that lit up the stadium and made you feel part of the show, not just watching it.The lightshow, the lasers, the ambiance. We didn't have the best spot to see the whole thing, but enough room to dance and see them when the got onto the runway- to enjoy the star/ leaf confetti the trade off  for not being able to see the whole thing in from afar- so the highlight for me was when they came OFF the stage, passed  by where I was standing on a path cut out by security guards and then sang Kingdom Come, only feet away- a song I used to play on my guitar and my son plays- who is presently in NYC- and THAT was my highlight. A beautiful song without all the flashing lights, a song close to me and my family. They are humble and they are fabulous musicians. They can make you laugh and sing and dance and cry.Keep on doing what you do.Please. ",1
Coldplay,"This was indeed, one of the best concerts I've ever been to. Opened by Ximena Sariñana and later on by Lianne La Havas (who I didn't previously know, but has an incredible voice btw), the concert started on time, and with a completely full venue. Coldplay has an amazing production, Chris Martin spoke in spanish several times and the people loved the band. The were baloons, fireworks, confetti, colored powder, and these bracelets that were given to everybody that turned on and off in different colors in sync with the music. Almost through the end, Christ Martin announced that they were recording a video for A Head Full of Dreams so they were playing again that song. Everybody went crazy. The setlist was great, balancing all the well-known songs from the band with the new songs from their latest album. I enjoyed the concert a lot a hope the visit Mexico again soon. ",1
Coldplay,"Great show with Coldplay .... when they finally came up on stage! The show should start at 19:00 - and it should include 2 guest appearances... that guest appearances turned up to be opening-acts! two completely worthless acts that started after 19:00 AND played 30min each + 30 min in between + then at least 30min to rig the stage before Coldplay went on just after 21:00. SUCH A DRAG! so Coldplay really had an up-hill start to overcome. why does it have to take so long time to change between a support act and the band everyone actually come to see?why can´t they fix the scene from the beginning??? I hate support-acts! and it should be clearly communicated BEFORE you buy tickets, if there is support-acts. ",-1
Coldplay,"Absolutely extraordinary and amazing show! This why is my nine-year-old son's first concert and he left saying that it was one of the best days of his life! It was magical! The billions pieces of confetti, fire and fireworks, as well as the enormous TV screens with fantastic videos. The production was truly incredible! Chris Martin and the whole Coldplay group went out of their way to make sure that everybody in the audience could see them. We had Fields seeds but the group performed in three different spots throughout the concert. I will never forget this concert. And what an amazing experience for my son as his first concert! Absolutely worth every penny! Thank You Coldplay for an extraordinary experience! ",1
Coldplay,"Excellent show, acoustics and energy. It's Coldplay, so you expect good music. Even then it is awesome that thousands of Germans know every song and sing along. Chris Martin, in particular, is a good showman and truly knows how to get the audience involved. This is, obviously, apart from the prodigious talent he is, as a singer and song writer. As a friend decided to point of out that she ""lost some respect"" because they used minus tracks in the show and she expects better from Coldplay. I say, millions disagree and enjoy the ""show"" and the ""songs"" anyway! If you get a chance, just go to watch these guys... Naysayers and holier than thou music critics are always around with one comment or another! ",1
Coldplay,"Colplay Brisbane 6th December 2016@ Suncorp Stadium These guys are the brightest, most humble and brilliant entertainers, we are lucky to havea band like Colplay. They delivered a fun filled interactive show with their confetti cannons, giant balloons that floated throughout the crowd. People all behaved and looked after each other in the muggy conditions,handing out water to those who needed it. Their stage and screen lit up bright like Christmas trees and everyone's wrist bands lit up to their music and created a more connected experience for all. I definitely recommend you catch Coldplay for they will remain in my heart and music memories for years to come. ",1
Coldplay,"WOW! Amazing! Felt so privileged to be there. I have seen Coldplay many times. This was by far one of the best gigs we have been to given the size of the venue and our close proximity to the band. It felt so intimate and the band were clearly on a high from winning their award.  As always, they were so grateful for the support of their fans and gave a great performance. Euphoria ensued as the band belted out some of their best tracks. Just brilliant! I would happily go back in time and watch it over, and over, and over again! Can't wait to see them next week at the WarChild gig at the O2, then again in June at Wembley and Glasto...thank you Coldplay for being awesome! ",1
Coldplay,"Dear Songkick, Coldplay's concert was a blast, thank you for asking! :) You mentioned that our reviews would help other songkickers decide whether it's worth seeing Coldplay live and my answer is hell yes! The experience was fantastic, the lights were amazing and the band really knows how to include their fans into the show. I've loved their music for quite some time and being a part of such an incredible adventure was the highlight of the past few years. Chris has the most amazing and reassuring voice and he sings just as awesome live as he does recorded. It was a beautiful evening and I'm very greatful to be a part of Coldplay's tour 2016. :) ",1
Coldplay,"Head Full of Dreams in the Singapore National Stadium is the best concert we've ever seen -- BAR NONE! We stood up at the VIP standing pen for almost 4 hours including the front act. Jess Kent was also amazing so we didn't mind the initial wait. Afterwards the magic of the main act stage slowly unfolded. We didn't realize we will not only be given an aural treat, but also visual and interactive plays during the concert. Awesome music, performance and a magical audience was all that we needed to sustain our energy for the night -- no matter all the sweat, pushing and shoving we took on as part of it. Coldplay simply ROCKS! ",1
Coldplay,"An amazing and almost epic experience. It was my fouth concert, but the first two was at festivals with a much smaller scale light show. The invention of giving the audience light wristbands has a dramatic effect, especially when it is almost dark, and is combined with changing colours and fireworks. Coldplay always sounds like they are enjoying playing live and enjoying each other. That brings a very special atmosphere to the show, and makes you feel important. The list of brilliant songs are long, and you have to dance and sing along. In short - don't miss a Coldplay concert if you have never been there. ",1
Coldplay,"Really fun and entertaining concert despite the rain and being Sunday night!!! The set list was already available from previous tour dates but I enjoyed all the dancing, fireworks, colors and lights at the show. I saw them last in 2006 in Dublin. They have grown since and have more money off course but despite the scripted/lock&stock show settings still one band one enjoy to see live in big venues and to which you can bring your family and friends They did songs from most of their albums which I found quite nice. Really an enjoyable show Martin even managed to get the Swiss crowd dancing, kudos to him ;) ",1
Drake,"Drake's energy on the stage is just incomparable to anybody I've seen. The way he connects with the crowd is unbelievable. I think that his energy on stage just get the crowd more hyped up so it's an all around good show whenever Drake performs.    From ""So Far Gone"" to ""Nothing Was The Same,"" his style and the way he gets his message across have stayed the same. That's the best thing about aging, you get better as time progresses and I think that his albums are a definite reminder of how lyrically and musically talented he is. Many artist make one or two good albums, maybe a song or two every now and then, but Drake has consistently been at the top releasing good music and is just on fire. It's easier to get to the top than to stay there, but he's proving to everyone that he has enough to get to the top and knock anyone down who try's to take him down. I love how he makes his music to fit any type of mood that you're feeling. His music isn't just slow R&B, he has some up-tempo music that will get you feeling pumped up and ready to go. I also love how he isn't like a Lil Wayne type of rapper who just uses auto tune and throws random gun verses in his songs. Every song is well thought out, every line is placed just right, the words flow with the beat and it's just magic. Even if you don't like Drake, when ""Hold on, We're Going Home"" comes on you're going to start singing. His songs are just too catchy, and are just classic, so 30 years from now people will still be blasting ""Take Care"" in their car.    From what I've watched, he gives the people their moneys worth and leaves them waiting to see Drakes next move or when he's dropping his next album. He's just an all around great artist and performer, strongly recommend seeing him. ",1
Drake,"I have never been a huge fan of Drake, but after becoming hooked on the 2013 song ‘Hold on we’re going home’, I decided to check out his back catalogue of work, and was really surprised with what I found, and immediately regretted discounting him previously. The combination of chilled out tracks in contrast with his rapping and songs like ‘Headlines’ provides such great listening variation, covering a variety of musical genres. Drake’s recent performance at this years Grammys was simply breath-taking, drawing in the audience to the narrative of ‘Hold on we’re going home’ without being showy or over the top, yet managing to merge smoothly into the track ‘Started from the Bottom’, providing the audience with a more upbeat track. Drake’s interaction with his audience, especially on this occasion is something which he deserves credit for, maintaining his vocal performance whilst attempting to greet as many fans as possible. For me, this injection of his personality really provides the fans with a motivation to watch him live, as the dedication to both performance and fans is something that he appears to have mastered. He really is one of those artists that you have to see live to experience the full potential of his music. ",1
Drake,I bought my tickets to Lil Wayne VS. Drake about 4 months ago and finally got to attend the show on Saturday. Wow. My mind was blown. First of all G-Easy Opened for them and really got the crowd warmed up for the headliners. The whole show was like a video game with Drake and Lil Wayne going back and forth with old and new hits which I was so impressed with how they really mixed it up. Drake flew above the crowd suspended holding on to a stripper pole looking stand which Lil Wayne later dogged on him for. They battled back and forth about being the most featured artist and at the end I had chills because they were both saying how grateful they were for keeping each other's music alive. It was inspiring and poetic. I was impressed it was definitely the best show I have been to this year! ,1
Drake,"Drake puts on a great show, honestly a great performer who is very talented. However, if you’re really going to tour with migos, and they don’t show up to do their opening set, there really should be some kind of refund. I came to the show expecting to see migos and then drake and then when migos didn’t show up I went into Drakes set disappointed about missing migos. Sure two of them came out and did 2 songs but really not enough. Instead of touring with these unreliable guys, tour by yourself, I would have no problem paying exactly what I paid for just Drake. ",0
Drake,"Tickets were very expensive. This was one of the most I have ever paid for a concert ticket, need to make it affordable for his fans. His stage presence was brilliant and loved how much he relates himself to the UK and a personal bond with Birmingham. He did lots of his lesser successful songs which was disappointing, songs like crew love which lots of his fans LOVE came on for 10 seconds then he switched into another one. Just felt it lacked real good performances of his better known and his best songs. ",0
Drake,"I really liked the show! Drake was an amazing entertainer and made me feel seen and made the show worthwhile. He really suprised me in a positive way:) I loved the sequals were he talked between the songs and the drirecting of scenery was incredible. Some of the most impressive stuff I have ever seen on a stage. He was a good singer, and I liked his tribute to Rihanna. Thanks Drake, for an awesome experience. You are way coolet than I thought ",1
Drake,One of the best concerts I've been to in a while...   Then opening act: party next door wasn't very well known  But when the main acts got on stage the party was really bumpin.   Great set list. I can say that I was standing and dancing the whole night and rapping along. They had an interactive portion to help decide who won the rap battle between Drake and Lil Wayne through a downloaded app on your phone. Overall awesome experience! ,1
Drake,"Amazing preformance! He's very enganging and interactive with the crowed, not to mention insanely talented! There was a really cool moving light show (globes of lights that were lowered and raised to create patterns above the audiance as well as change colors). Would have loved to hear more from some of his first albums but all in all a fantastic show. Definatly was worth spending the extra money for floor seats :) ",1
Drake,The Drake vs Lil wayne show was definantly a must see! The whole competitive feel of them trying to one up eachother really drove the energy up! Drake is amazing live but honestly Lil Wayne stole the show for me. Also the production value is through the roof! It's less of a concert and more of an experience! They played all of their hits as well as their old stuff! Definantly get a seat to this one! ,1
Drake,Drake was unbelievable on a whole his chats in between the songs conveyed important messages and overall he was just so unbelievable to see live I would 100% recommend. He even took someones Odell Beckham Jr Jersey from them when walking to the stage and got it signed by Odell Beckham Jr and then gave it back to him. Inspiration and truly amazing man. ,1
Drake,The show was soo good. The firsts parts were too long but when Drake arrived the stage was on fire and everybody was singing all his songs. He said also a lot of beautiful things about how the world is today and this was so emotional. I really want to go again to his concert if he'll come in a few years.That was a fucking good experience damn it! ,1
Drake,"I was so annoyed that he rescheduled the show and then on top of that, he didn't come on stage until close to 10pm. But he made up for it with a great show and he brought out Trey Songz, Giggs, Skepta, Popcaan and Nicki Minaj. Incredible atmosphere, great performance, and just a brilliant show in all. Drizzy showed a lot of love for London! ",1
Drake,My first real concert and I am not disappointed at all. He is such a great artist and it was literally one of the best nights of my life. There's no difference when he sings on stage to on the songs that are recorded. I can't explain how happy I was and I had such a great time. I can't wait for him to come back one more time as he said. #6god ,1
Drake,"Amazing!!!! Way above any expectations I had of the show! Not only was the music great and Drake's voice even greater (live!!), him as an entertainer was really impressive. The way he interacted with the audience and spoke to ALL of us was so enjoyable. I'd recommend for anyone considering to buy tickets to his shows to DO IT. ",1
Drake,Great setlist. A good balance whithin his repertoire. He played some hits for the girls and others for the boys but in general the setlist was built to turn up the audience. Visually it was interesting. Quite impressing. Glad to see that he brought some real musicians with him (drummer and keyboards player) besides his DJ. ,1
Drake,"The show was amazing and was definitely worth every cent! Drake and Migos put on a great show, however there was a long wait. We had to wait almost two hours after the time the concert was supposed to start, but I mean the show made up for it and Drake went past the time it was supposed to end and gave us our moneys worth. ",0
Drake,I was really excited before the concert. Drake delayed the concert by a month promising a spectacular production. I hate that it was on Monday but the production was indeed spectacular. Drake was late by 40 minutes but he also ended up playing 40 more minutes. Next time though he could talk less and start the mosh sooner. ,0
Drake,"I love Drake's concerts, the energy and the performance he brings on stage is amazing. No wonder he is one of the best rappers we have. I always get t-shirts with his lyrics and get so many compliments at his concerts. If you guys want to get his typographical lyrics printed on a shirt go to albumapparel.com/ ",1
Drake,"I attended the show on a Saturday night and wasn't expecting much from the 6 God except for good bars. How wrong was I... The set was amazing,  and he interacted with the crowd really well. I've been to Adele,  micheal Jackson and even Bowie,  but this was by far the best show i have ever been to. ",1
Drake,Awesome concert! The guy is a MF performer! He honored the bay area rap history by bringing a lot if the local ethos of the culture. Drake himself was amazing and really dedicated to his crowd that responded accordingly to his generosity during the show. Very relaxes and authentic Drake. ,1
Eminem,"“EMINEM.”    Seeing his name lit across the stage was mind blowing. As if natural instinct, everyone started chanting, ‘EM-IN-EM, EM-IN-EM’, until the legend himself took the stage, wearing a get up that only the King of Rap could pull off. Without a breathe of a moment, he jumps directly in to rapping, setting the crowd on fire as most of us have been waiting in the stadium for hours, and some of us have been waiting for years. As far back as we can remember, Eminem was there, withstanding the wrath of time and still being able to top the charts many, many years later. The audience was as real as he is, old, young (too young), male, female and people of all colours were there. I could see it in their eyes, as they threw their hands to the beat and mouthed every word along with him, that at this moment, this is all they have ever wanted. When songs like “Lose Yourself”, “Stan”, “Not Afraid” and a few others were sung, tears flowed freely, because like every other person, those songs were a part of various struggles and difficulties you  or someone you are close to have faced.    That’s not to say the concert is a downer, no, not at all. Once you’ve wiped your tears away, “Without Me”, “The Real Slim Shady”, “Rap God” and more is performed, to get your body moving, dancing, jumping, flashing, whatever you are in to. Aside from the upbeat tracks, his stage presence is something else, he manages to be filthy and charming all at the same time. And by the end of the show, you’re speechless. Firstly, because you’re in shock due to the fact that you have never experienced a level of such greatness, and secondly, because your voice is gone as rapping alongside the one and only Eminem, is not as easy as he makes it look. ",1
Eminem,"Eminem in concert in LA was enough to make me extraordinarily happy, but for him to perform some hits from the Recovery album made the entire night absolutely worth it!! It was nostalgic for him to perform his old hits, taking me back to elementary and junior high school days, but Recovery was the album that solidified my love and appreciation for his artistry, talent and heart! Em's portion of the show was absolutely fantastic, he is truly a lyrical genius and he never fails to deliever with an energy and intensity that is infectious! I would have been more than happy (and actually would have preferred) if the show was just his performance, but I can fully understand why he would need someone to fill some time to give him a break between his sets. When he performs it feels like he is literally pouring his heart and soul out on the stage and that has to be beyond exhausting for him, hence the need for Rihanna. Her part was ok.    The venue (the Rose Bowl) was an experience in itself. Parking wasn't as bad as I was anticipating, but it was very expensive. The arena was packed solid, but I never felt too overwhelmed by people even though I was on the floor. It was just great to be surrounded by people who were enjoying the concert.    If you ever have a chance to see Em in concert, I would say, GO! ",1
Eminem,"I have been a huge Eminem fan since he came out with Cleaning Out My Closet, I was very very young at the time so I've been a fan since I was a little kid. I was very much looking forward to my first Eminem concert, and on 8/16 at MetLife Stadium, my dream finally came true.  The website said they would start at 7:30, but they didn't start until like 8:40, but the whole concert made up for it.   Eminem was amazing, I honestly have no words to describe the experience except that it was very unreal and I had to pinch myself a few times just to make sure this was really happening to me. He played a lot of his songs off his first two albums and then some songs off of Recovery & MMLP2.   For anyone who had seats or had Floor B GA, you really missed out on an amazing view & concert. The view from the 200s & 300s probably sucked, they could only probably see Eminem & Rihanna from the jumbo screens.  Rihanna was great too, she was very sweet & funny live, as well as sexy & seductive.  Eminem was funny and his stage presence was wonderful.  This was an experience I'd LOVE to have again, an experience many should get to enjoy and from the amazing view in GA. I do hope he goes on tour again in the next year or so. ",1
Eminem,"Fucking amazing!! Man’s music has saved my life so many times! A real artist and an incredible lyricist... unbaleaveablw how much talent Marshal has. Tears dropped as he sung songs that touched my heart and took me back from the grave... I love him for all he has done for me an my recovery... if only I was able to thank him in person... In rehab they say to believe in power that’s greater than me, as my god. Eminem is that god to me. A powerful man that I know has saved so many lives just from his music. The show was the best show I’ve ever attended. Only issue was I wasn’t quick enough to get a ticket I the pit. I would have rocked up at 6am before the concert just to get into the front row and thank the ma. For everything he has done for my life.. But I don’t think I’ll ever get the chance to thanks him and praise Marshal. But I doubt I’ll Ever get the chance to express the abundance of help, love and strength I receive when ever I lisfen  laying down to his tracks!!!  An I doubt he’ll ever truely know how many llivws he has saves and touched!!!  100/10 for the show!!! Bring him back pleaseeee!!! ",1
Eminem,"I have been a fan of Eminem in 1999, I was leaving 4 meps,right be4 basic training and i was getting picked up at 11am, and i was drinking about 6am and in Chicago there was a video channel that played diff videos 24/7 around 6ish am i saw his video i just don't give af,and i was like hell ya a white boy.Then in basic on a Sunday while some people went 2 church i snuck outta the barreks and bought a walk men cd player and they had the SSLP there so i grabbed that,and that helped get me threw basic training, and when i got 2 my unit i bought a z28 97,and got a system put in it and the MMLP came out and the bass use 2 make my whip shake,but i no lots of what he talks about cuz ive had so many close friends get killed  in drive buys lots i no that oded,i was hooked on pills,lot of what he says i feel, like i was the only white kid growing up in my part of chi,so ive been a stan sence be4 stan ever came out, EMIN3M 4LIFE.

Eminem,"Where do I start, right let’s try.... I’ve been lucky enough to see Eminem 3 Times now, first time was v festival where he was absolutely superb and stole the show. Second was at Wembley, where yet again he smashed it, and too bring out dre was unbelievable and the crowd went insane, personally thought, u are not topping that.... but now to twickenham, where I didn’t think he could possibly get any better or fulfill his thousands and thousands of fans, but how stupid was I haha, not only delivers the best show/concert I’ve ever been to and seen but upped the anti and performs the best I’ve ever seen and I’ve seen a few acts, not to finish there, but brings out not just 50 cent but ed sheeran also and the crowd just goes insane and lifted the roof off.... By far the best performer/performance I’ve been luckily enough to witness Regards Darren ",1
Eminem,"I FINALLY got to see Eminem live after being a fan since day one. What can I say that will do the performance justice? He was AMAZING! Everything that I ever imagined in my mind an Eminem concert would be, well it was 10 times better than that. He was on point with his flow, the sound was awesome, the stage design was great too but honestly I didn't even pay that much attention to that because I was focusing on him the entire time. It was a long time coming for me to see him live and man did he exceed my expectations. Few shows have ever hit that top mark for me and wow he did it. There really are no words that I can say that will give him the credit he deserves for being an amazing artist and performer. All I can say is if you get a chance to watch him, DO IT! You will not be disappointed. I can't wait to be able to watch him again! ",1
Eminem,"Marshal a.k..a Eminem, you are the best music star ever! I listen to your music everyday becuase I love how you put your anger and pain into the words of your songs, ""I'm Sorry Mama, I never meant to hurt you, I never meant to make you cry"" is one of the best emotional phrases you have used even though you think you have hurt them they will always love you and make sure you are safe. I will always buy your albums when they are released and even try and come to one of your concerts, hopefully meaning I get to meet you and ask for a picture with you and ask you nicely to sign my albums and posters I have. You are my favourite singer of all time. I am your biggest fan ever! From Curtis P.S. You are the best, hopefully I get to meet you and that would be the best day of my life I would never forget it and never forget you! ",1
Eminem,"Eminem is epic. Eminem live is mind blowing!   Live he performs a great variety of songs from all of his albums, mixing in some of his old stuff which brings feelings of nostalgia with his newer stuff which sounds great.   He has got to be one of the best rappers of all time and the fact that he writes all his lyrics himself gives the songs depth and meaning. He's a lyrical genius!   Watching him live is a roller coaster of emotions from jumping up and down and going wild to swaying your hands in the air with a sing-a-long.   Even though Wembley held thousands he still performed like it was to each and every one of you, interacting with the crowd and showing off his great sense of humor.  Eminem is amazing and I would highly recommend seeing him live, there's no feeling like it. ",1
Eminem,"Phenomenal. Just as with his Wembley Stadium show 4 years prior, Eminem executed a powerful performance of a diverse array of classics spanning his whole career. He demonstrated why he is heralded by many as not only the greatest Hip Hop artist of all time, but one of the most iconic artists in music still today. Seeing him reunite with 50 Cent on stage was a fan-pleasing nostalgia trip of legend. Ed Sheeran, Royce Da 5'9 and Skylar Grey also helped to light the stage and prestige even further. This was the perfect experience for Slim Shady fans. Utterly remarkable. ",1
Eminem,"I am very very anxious to see him soon I hope!!! Listen to him as long as I can remember his first album!!! I pray he comes somewhere near ALABAMA soon!!! It would make my millennium!!!! If u see this M, I want u to know that I am a 43 year old man and I been listening to you forever it seems like and would love for my wife and I to see u live!!!! Keep on keeping on! You r my favorite music artist! God really gave u a talent that I wish I could have! Good luck with the rest of your career and God bless! ",0
Eminem,"Considering I have been a massive fan of Eminem since I was introduced to his music at the tender age of Seven; I believe I did a great job of staying calm. Despite waiting a long time for the legend himself to appear on stage, the concert exceeded all expectations! Eminem, Shady and Marshal Mathers were all present at the gig and he just emits brilliance. I can honestly say it was one of the best concerts I have been to in. Eminem is a brilliant artist and he was worth all the money spent. ",1
Eminem,"Absolutely amazing, the energy he put off was incredible. He played a lot of his old classic songs that every time loves and of course some new stuff. I got to experience Kamikaze section front row and it was well worth the wait, money and the aches and pains. He was that incredible I could of stood there for a further 5 hours watching his show All round what a great preformer, brilliant artist and he really showed why he is our rap god. ",1
Eminem,"An amazing and energic concert. An amazing feeling and Im soo moved. The downside thought is the arena which isn't the best one for the viewrs, from a big areana where you almost can see the stage whater your 400meters from the stage on the side or the oposite side of the arena, the sound isn't really the best either and the caos when 57000 people are trying to get out and you get stuck and can't move. But other than that it's a 10 out of 10 ",0
Eminem,"It was absolutely amazing... It was Eminem and Rihanna on August 17th. They were half an hour late which is fine. The production was amazing, Rihanna is a goddess and Eminem is a god. Everything was perfect, the set list had everything it should. MetLife Stadium is a great venue as well. Unfortunately the transportation back to NY was chaotic, but far from spoiling what an amazing concert we had. Truly amazing ",1
Eminem,"Seeing Eminem is a dream that every person that's grown up in the 90's wishes to tick off their bucket list! Seeing him last year at reading was amazing, 50,000+ people singing along to every word of his songs! I can't explain how euphoric it was! and with his return to wembley this year I'm sure it'll be just as crazy as last year! Can't wait! ",1
Eminem,I haven't seen him but love his music I relate to it I'm 52 but when I'm 70 I'll still lission to him. I'm in Iowa cedar rapids I'm begging him to come here he has a lot of fans here. So if u see this please come to the us cellular center here 52402 in Iowa so I can come see u please love u your biggest fan anna ,0
Eminem,We had a lot of fun Even my brother enjoy a lot I was absent from work until I attended the concert Go to work by helicopter And then I travel transit to Abu Dhabi But it was worth it But my brother was hoping to take his picture with him The towel that was thrown was next to us But we were not lucky ,1
Eminem,"It was perfect!! I like that security staff was very friendly and reacting so quickly if something were going wrong. WC were really very clean. We were stayed in the first line so our shoes were dry, so we were lucky because it was raining a little bit. Eminem was unreal, we love it and we will comeback :) ",1
Maroon 5,"Sometimes when you hear a band that you love perform live for the first time, you're a bit disappointed because they do not sound as great as they do in the recordings. Well, that is NOT the case with Maroon 5, what you hear on recording is what you get live. Adam Levine has an amazing voice. He is super talented, and they made no mistake when they decided to make him a judge on the show, The Voice. I could watch him perform live with his band all day. Some of my very favorite songs by Maroon 5 are their old ones such as “Never Gonna Leave This Bed”, “Harder To Breathe”, and “Misery” but when they start singing “Payphone”, I go crazy. I absolutely love this song performed live! Perhaps the best song to see them perform live is “Moves Like Jagger”. It makes you move when you hear it on the radio, but when you hear it live, you're dancing non stop. Maroon 5 concerts are mostly upbeat and fun, but there are times when it slows down and they perform those songs that make you want to call your ex. The atmosphere to their concerts is just right. Chill at times, but also upbeat and loud. Put Maroon 5 on your list of bands to see live because you will not be disappointed. ",1
Maroon 5,"Maroon 5 have been constant and consistent in the charts over their long career which now spans almost fifteen years. The band, fronted by Adam Levine has come along way since the immediate success with 'Songs For Jane'. Now working on their sixth album, they obtain a consistency within their live show to match. Armed with a plethora of hits, the band tear into 'One More Night' from the 2012 album 'Overexposed'. The audience singalong as Levine confidently struts around the stage commanding his loyal followers. A good mixture of material old and new make for a solid setlist where the band are able to show consistency through their recordings as the likes of 'Sunday Morning' and 'Maps' sit well together and achieve an equally positive reaction. A real track of the 00's, 'She Will Be Loved' makes for perhaps the largest singalong of the evening as the crowd proudly attempt the high, long notes in the same way Adam does during the chorus. Evidently hitting their stride with latest album 'V', Maroon 5 impress crowds by remaining as relevant now as they were during their incarnation back in 2002. ",1
Maroon 5,"This is my second show in the last 2 years and neither time was I disappointed in the least.  This time I was fortunate enough to have the money I saved to purchase pretty good seats. I am now spoiled and can no longer sit in the stands.  I am already saving my money for the next US tour in hopes to be even closer next show.  No matter where your seats though....Adam is all over the stage in high energy, which is very infectious!!  Anyone who did not enjoy that show, must not have been paying attention.  They sounded awesome live...awesome!!  Adam made the audience feel as though they were part of the show and VERY, VERY much appreciated!  The lights were perfect, the set list was awesome as well.  They played much longer than most people expected and the encore was just as great as the rest of the show, maybe even better.  Maybe that is because I am partial to ""Moves Like Jagger"" and there it was....This was worth every dollar I paid, which was way more than I would pay to see anyone but maroon 5!!  If  you get a chance to see them sometime....make it a point....you will fall in love!! ",1
Maroon 5,"IT WAS SOOOOOO AMAZING. they played all the songs i grew up listening to so all the memories just came flooding in and it was simply the best experience EVERR! seeing my favs live in concert was so LIT. What Lovers Do, Payphone, Maps, Cold, Sugar, Sunday Morning, Wait, Girls Like You, This Love AND MOVES LIKE JAGGER WOOO these are all my favourites and they played all of them AND MORE!!! i can’t barely describe how amazing this experience was. i was a bit upset that they didn’t perform an encore and some songs from the album that i really thought would be played like Help Me Out and Whiskey. from what my sister told me, Maroon 5 performed an encore last time round so i was quite let down when the concert ended without an one this time. nevertheless, it was a still a fantastic performance and i really hope to see them again soon!!! ",1
Maroon 5,"No food allowed into the event, and the only food available from vendors was junk food (3-4 different pizza vendors, 2-3 sub vendors), not 1 single option for those wishing to eat healthy (not even a freaking salad was available anywhere). Paid over $300 for ""zone 1 seating"", which was PACKED and there really was no ""seating"" as it was on the beach and turned into a free for all battle for a spot. Lines into and out of ""seating zones"" were HORRIBLE throughout the ENTIRE event! The shitty food vendors were located past ""zone 3"" which meant that getting a bite to eat was about an hour process for those of us in zone 1! Absolutely the last time I'm ever attending a concert at this venue! As for the show itself, Maroon V was good, but for some reason decided to only play 3-4 songs from their new album.. Go figure. ",-1
Maroon 5,"I've been waiting to see Maroon 5 for 6 years and I'm so glad I finally did it. I love that they didn't lose the essence of them as a pop rock band and a as a collective of musicians rather than just Adam Levine, especially since that's what it seems like in recent albums V and Red Pill Blues. They started the show with videos and interacted a lot with the audience which made it a memorable show! That said, Adam Levines voice was a little off... most of the time. He can't hit high notes and instead of really singing the lyrics sometimes it seemed like he was talking. Still enjoyed the solos and appreciate that they played more ""rock"" songs like Harder To Breathe as well as their very recent pop music. ",0
Maroon 5,"The band was really good at times, but Adam Levine did not seem to be at his best. Entire show including encore was 1:20. No real effects, which is ok, if the music is great, but no one was super impressed with the performance. Maybe an off day. If you are thinking about getting the VIP package- DON'T! Complete rip off and Maroon 5 and VIP Nations EU should be ashamed. Grocery bag with Maroon 5 on it, a lanyard, a silk screen pillow (seriously), and cheap sunglasses. No band photos, certainly no pictures with you and the band, no autographed anything. Complete and utter SH*T for your extra money. They also made us wait outside for 35 minutes, 28 degree heat, beyond their published entrance opening, no apology. Awful! ",-1
Maroon 5,"Third try: Songkick doesn't want any bad reviews. Maroon 5 was nothing spectacular. Adam Levine seemed to be off and sometimes stopped singing in the middle of the song. Entire set was 1hour 20 minutes, including encore. VIP package was a total rip off. Small cloth bag with Maroon 5 on the side, an ugly silk screen Maroon 5 pillow (really?), a lanyard, and cheap sunglasses. No autographed anything, no picture of the band, no picks, nothing to make you feel you got something special. The band and VIP Nation EU should be ashamed! They also made the ""VIPs"" wait for 35 minutes outside in 28 degree heat. This was beyond their published doors opening time and no apology. DO NOT waste your money on this. ",-1

Maroon 5,"I'm sure it was a fantastic concert.  I had grabbed two great seats back on the first day they went on sale. Health issues have pretty much made me housebound since February 2008. But I was willing to pay the ticket price just in case I felt well enough to go Wednesday night the decision had to be made once and for all.  I was scheduled to fly from Kansas City MO to Nashville the next day. Saddened last night that I missed the concert, just one more thing my illness got in the way of my leading a normal or semi normal life. I decided to just listen to Maroon 5 downloads on my IPad  and hope that I can make the Kansas City show in March. ",0
Maroon 5,"I missed them every time they came to Toronto. Finally got to see them live and it was everything I thought it would be. The band was top notch, the stage setup was simple but it gave such a different look. Minus the little mini blackout and tantrum that Adam had (he also threw the mic on the floor and it inadvertently hit a fan on the head - she was fine) Adam was nice enough to pull her on stage and apologize even though we couldn't hear a single thing lol Adam's voice was on point. I didn't want the concert to end. I will definitely see them again when they come back, hopefully I don't miss out on tickets again ",1
Maroon 5,"In my view, D J's participation at the beginning was too long, which only increased our wait and anxiety to see Maroon5. The place where it was extremely organized and it was possible for everyone present to enjoy an incredible presentation with a very cool setlist of “new” and “older” songs. For me it was a great show and certainly worth it! Levine on stage is awesome as are all the members, always moving around and making jokes between them and the audience. Concert highly recommended!",1
Maroon 5,"The band's performance was wonderful. Note 1000 !!! I would just like to leave a suggestion to the event organizers regarding the layout of the venue. He has been to concerts at Jeunesse Arena before and the closed space is more appropriate for this type of event due to the heat of the city of Rio de Janeiro, the possibility of contemplating the show of the chairs, the protection in the case of rain and the air conditioning that it certainly benefits the musician / band that is not used to our heat. Ao Maroon Five: come back anytime you want!",1
Maroon 5,"I expected so much! I loved Maroon 5 and Adam Levine and their songs will stay in my heart even after this big disappointment. I was looking ahead for jokes, connection with us (the public), even a 'Hello, Bucharest' would have made me happy. Instead, we got a cold and arrogant attitude, no more than 100 words addressed to us during the entire show, and some 'We love you, you're extraordinary, we'll be back' thrown in our faces at the end. Duty fulfilled, paycheck cashed in. They did not deserve the public they got! Yes, Mommy, yes! ",-1
Maroon 5,"Great concert Loved the energy and sound. The engagement with the audience was wonderful not too forced. Only thing I didn't like was the playlist of songs. Really wished they would have done some of their other music.  Like ;Little of your time, Stutter, Shudder, Tangled, Man who never lied, Let's stay together, and If I ain't got you. Adams voice in the last two songs sounds like velvet.  Will see them again. TOV Lo was very good  R City ok didn't know much of their music they sing. Tammy J McCrary Kincaid ",1
Maroon 5,"WOW!!!!  We had fantastic seats near the stage however, wherever you were sitting/standng you experienced a great concert.  Adam sang non-stop for the first 20mins or so and what a voice!!  He included all their classics - payphone, jagger etc as well as their current album.  And to top it at the end, they had decided to film their next video - such fun.  Great night, amazing concert, perfect venue!  Want to do it all again asap! ",1
Maroon 5,The most Fun concert ever! This was the  third time I brought my niece to see Maroon 5. We were singing and dancing the entire concert. The most entertaining and highly energetic performance with amazing vocals. I have been a fan for many years and I love sharing the experience with my niece who is equally appreciative. Thank you for setting the bar for our concert going experiences for 2015. Much love from Minneapolis. ,1
Maroon 5,"so good. I sat up in the top section, but the view was still incredible and my friend and I had an amazing time. the lights added onto the emotion of each song. I cried during Sunday Morning, just because it was amazing to finally hear such an important song to me live. Adam's beautiful. There was a drunk girl who jumped up on stage and tried to kiss him, but other than that, it was a flawless concert. ",1
Maroon 5,"Boooring!!! The concert was very plain, no punch at any time. It was Mexico City, come on!!! the audince there is amazing!!! It would have been better to sit at home and watch their concert on TV. When you thought it couldnt get worst, it ended!! it was only 1:20 minutes. Althoght I had great seats and Adam Levine is super hot, my conclusion is that it was a short, boring and expensive concert. ",-1
Ed Sheeran,"Great show! I bought my wife and I tickets as a gift for her (she was a huge Ed Sheeran fan even before he was famous) and we had a great time. My wife had never been to the venue, and while I had been to shows at Consol Enery Center before this was the first show I saw there since it became PPG Paints Arena. Everything about the production and performances (lights, audio, visuals, crew, musicians etc) went off with nary a hitch and was executed in a very timely manner. Props to all involved. James Blunt opened, and like many people there (as he joked) I only knew one of his songs: ""You're Beautiful"". He was funny, charismatic, a good showman, and a good sport. He put on a high quality emotion filled performance, and despite his music being on the sadder side still managed to pump everyone up for Ed Sheeran. ""Don't Give Me Those Eyes"" was a highlight. He hung out in the Captain Morgan lounge after his performance and invited anyone interested to come hang with him. I came in not really knowing who he was and left checking out his latest music and regretting not grabbing a beer with him. Than Ed came out (my wife had a pinch me I'm dreaming moment). He was noticeably quieter and a bit more reserved than Blunt when addressing the audience, but quickly dove in. I was always aware Ed was a talented solo artist, but you really appreciate his talent on a different level when you actually hear him perform outside of a studio live with just him and a guitar. Most of his songs were studio quality. A few songs dipped in quality but for charming and understandable reasons like audience involvement and impressive sped-up improv (i.e. the ""Don't"" and ""New Man"" mashup). He played nearly all the songs my wife and I were looking for (""Perfect"", ""A-Team"", ""Galway Girl"", ""Nancy Mulligan"", ""Thinking Out Loud"", etc.). Since this was the ""Divide"" tour he played almost every song off that album (but not all: no ""Barcelona"", ""Bibia be ye ye"", etc.) He also played a lot of his older songs, including an audience request for ""Cold Coffee"" (he stated it was the first time he performed it live since 2010-2011). I also liked how he put on a Pittsburgh Penguins jersey during his closing song ""You Need Me and I Don't Need You"". TLDR it was one of the best shows I have seen. ",1
Ed Sheeran,"It is safe to say that Ed Sheeran will be one of the defining artists of our generation. His music transcends any definable genre, combining soft folk with bright pop and grime hip-hop. Sheeran's clever wordplay and soulful lyrics are able to really captivate an audience, both when listening to him live or on a CD. One of the most salient qualities about him though, is his pure, unaltered, truly beautiful voice.    It is hard to really visualize how great he sounds until you see him live. I was lucky enough to see him at a small, intimate performance with a crowd of only about 100. The first thing you notice about him is that it is just him up on stage. There is no band, no backing vocals, no track playing in the background or anything. It is him, a guitar, and a loop pedal. From the moment he struck the first chord until the moment he stepped off stage, the audience was enchanted by him. His voice can transport you from an old pub in Ireland to the grimy streets of London without ever missing a beat. A real troubadour, his shining moments are the ballads in which soaring vocals and romantic lyrics backed by the simple strum of his Little Martin cause major swooning. It was evident to me that Sheeran deserves all of the attention he gets and more; his talent is truly undeniable, even if he isn't your favorite. He is so incredibly down-to-Earth, as well. I was able to meet him after he performed and he genuinely cared about what I had to say to him. He was warm, friendly, funny, and exceedingly normal. He's someone that you would want to hang out and watch TV with. With his new album ""x"" (pronounced ""multiply"") Sheeran shows how much he has grown as an artist since the release of his debut album ""+"" three years ago. His love is more passionate, his hurt is more palpable, and when he throws shade, it's pretty intense. At the end of the day, he is a performer. You can tell how much music means to him when you see him live. He is a true artist: a beautiful lyricist, a stunning vocalist, and an incredibly entertaining musician. ",1
Ed Sheeran,"Let me just start off by saying Ed Sheeran is an amazing performer and speaker. He is comedic and doesn't require thousands of lights and a massive stage to impress thousands. He stayed interactive with the crowd very well. This is my 3rd concert ever and it was both the best and worst I have ever. Ed Sheeran did amazing, he isn't the issue. As people know in concerts you stand and dance to most songs and sit (under circumstances) when ballads are playing or the performer is speaking. So- I was standing during one of Ed Sheeran's many sings along/dancing songs. I am a 6 foot tall 13 years old there for my birthday. In the area, I was in many people asked me to sit while he talked which I happily obliged to then learning the rules. It was all fine until one man yelled in a very rude/angry voice yelled at me (during a dancing song) ""SIT DOWN IDIOT IN THE BLACK HAT."" Which at the very moment I didn't recognize as myself until my father went to lash back (as any protective super concert dad would do). This is something I had never experienced. So for the rest of the concert, I sat having an emotional/mental breakdown. I'm not sure if it was the music or the people that made me cry so much. This was an experience I will learn from. Unfortunately, it is (probably) because Ed Sheeran reins in a large age group as an audience. This means sometimes people will be cranky, rude, or just plain snarky. I understand if someone handicapped asked me to sit because they couldn't stand. But this man that yelled at me was about 50 or younger. I hope he ended up enjoying his concert because by halfway through my whole 6' or taller family stood and danced. He sat and everyone around him was asking him to join. Sorry for my rant. Ed Sheeran is an amazing performer. I just thought you should know that people that (I know) will be everywhere (and we cant do much about them). But it was rude. ",1
Ed Sheeran,"Ed was fantastic! He played with no band or backtrack, but instead recorded himself and looped it as he went along to create the illusion of a backtrack or band. With only one person on stage in such a huge arena, there was a lot of opportunity to for the show to grow dry or redundant, especially for those sitting far away. However, he managed to keep me entertained the whole show with an AMAZING graphic show to accompany him. Each of his songs had a unique visual and light show that included scenes from music videos, new visuals, and video to project his performance. There was so much to look at I didn't even mind sitting far away (second level). He was also very interactive with the crowd, asking us to sing along for most songs, telling stories, and even managing to request and achieve (near) complete silence from the audience during the few songs he deemed needed it. He's got just as amazing of a voice live as on his albums and managed to play all of my personal favorite songs in the span of his set, including a nice mixture of ""plus"" and ""multiply"" Plus, his rapping is 10x more impressive live. Between being his own DJ, spitting out verses quicker than I thought possible, and jumping around stage, it's hard to find out when he has time to breathe. But he kept his energy up throughout the whole show. The exciting surprise of the event was during the encore, when he started singing ""Chasing Cars"" and was joined on stage by Gary Lightbody of Snow Patrol. He ended the snow and left the stage with his single ""Sing"" still looping, leaving the song and his performance stuck in everyone's head for the rest of the night.    Overall, he was a skilled entertainer, one I would Definitially recommend to all who enjoy his music. ",1
Ed Sheeran,"I have seen 300 concerts. This evening is in my top ten. The sheet quality of his songs, what he achieves with his looping, and the visuals on the screen were excellent. There were a few occasions during the night when Ed was bashing away at his guitar, lost in that massive cacophony,of sound, that I thought that the Budweiser Gardens might blast off into space! Excellent. Ed also has a powerful voice and a fairly extensive knowledge of soul music. Some of the snippets he threw into songs last night were fantastic. There were some transcendental moments in that show were I felt that anything could happen. People were stunned. Also, the way that he deconstructed some of the fan favourites was very interesting to watch and listen to. All that said, I think needs some assistance in creating more flow to the show and in reaching out to his audience in a meaningful way. He is 24. His songs are unreal. He knows how good he is. I hope that the stagecraft develops further with maturity. Songs like Photograph and Thinking Out Loud were a bit understated. Again, the quality of the songs allowed for a successful delivery. However, a song like Thinking out Loud is one for the ages. People will connect to that song forevermore. That piece needs to be a showstopper; a song that leaves the audiences emotional avd feeling connected to each other. He did not deliver in this department last night. His delivery on songs like this felt a bit selfish - a bit of a disappointment. Ed Sheeran might level off in terms of the songs that he delivers to the world. If, on the other hand, they keep getting better we could be looking at a new kind of stardom. This boy is unreal. The world owns this guy now. ",1
Ed Sheeran,"I don't know if it was the galavanting with Taylor Swift, but I know what you are thinking… Ed Sheeran is a ginger with a One Direction pre-teen fanatic following, and I'm not sure if I want to experience that live. Well I am here to tell you, you do. You really need to see Ed Sheeran live the next chance you get. I've been a fan of Ed Sheeran since I first heard ""You Need Me"" in 2011. Since then, Ed Sheeran has exploded, touring with Snow Patrol and (of course) Tay Swifty. I'm not sure if it was the time spent with Gary Lightbody and Snow Patrol, but Ed Sheeran has refined his songwriting to pull at your heartstrings and bring you on a 3 minute plus journey of love, loss, and sometimes revenge. When I had an opportunity to see him live for the first time this year, he was playing a massive stadium in Philadelphia.  I was as ready as I could be for all the screaming pre-teens, but looking around before the show started the thing that surprised me most was the stage set up: two mics, two guitars and a loop pedal at the very front of the stage. The next couple hours were a thrilling experience of watch Ed Sheeran build his songs from those 3 things, using his guitar as drums, layering vocals to harmonize with himself, and using the crowd as an award winning choir. With all of the production on the new album, I completely expected him to have a huge band on stage. Yet, just as he had done when he first started on the street and at open mic nights, Ed Sheeran played completely by himself… in a stadium. This is definitely a case of the pop music world getting it right… Ed Sheeran is a huge talent who deserves to be massive, and you will agree next time you see him live. ",1
Ed Sheeran,"After a 4.5hr drive to see the show we weren’t disappointed! Lewis Capaldi was first up and as funny and great as ever. Had the crowd laughing. The Darkness were not my thing but they engaged with one particular guy called “Rick” in the crowd, who also sang his heart out for an appreciative audience. The main man Ed appeared on stage around 8.30pm with a huge smile on his face, to an immense welcome from the Ipswich crowd, he was born not too far away, so was nice to see him finish this huge 2 year world tour at home. Also he gave hundreds of free tickets to the pupils of the school he attended when he lived there. His vocals were simply incredible, loud, strong, smooth and steamy,  just beautiful !! Screen graphics and timings were perfect too. His guitar playing was awesome to watch and I have no idea how he concentrates on so many things at once with the loop, that is pure talent and the build up and sound in some songs ie Eraser, Bloodstream and the awesome You need me,I don’t need you gave me goosebumps. Ed was joined for Galway Girl by Beoga which was brilliant. Special guest Stormzy for “Shape of You” was the icing on the cake and I’m so pleased I bought the tickets last year, they were worth every penny. Only complaint was the rude and miserable guy behind the official merch counter!! Spending £50 on a hoodie for my daughter meant I had to save for it and it would have been nice to have had a “hello” a “thank-you” or any kind of a smile!!! Luckily the bar staff were friendly, smiley and helpful as were the local people. Would 100% recommend ED SHEERAN as someone to see live, he is INCREDIBLE. Mandy x ",1
Ed Sheeran,"Seeing Ed Sheeran live was an incredible experience. Ed is not just a singer, but a brilliant artist, because every song of his is a work of art. He is 23 years old and he has released two albums, twelve EPs and collaborated with many successful artists. If you doubt about seeing him live, because you're not really a big fan and you know a few of his most successful songs (The A-team, Lego House, Drunk, Give Me Love) - don't doubt my friend. Why?   Let me tell you why. You know this feeling when you have to drive to a concert and you're already exhausted and the summer heat is making you all giddy? And then you have to wait in line and the heat is really bothering you? Well my friend, you forget all about it once Mr. Sheeran comes to the stage. The way he presents himself and his music is brilliant. He's just one man on the stage but he is all over the place. He makes sure we are all listening to him and not just screaming whenever he opens his mouth and a beautiful note comes out. During some of the songs you need to be quiet, and oh boy, we were quiet. It was like the crowd was holding their breath. Something I really like about him, is that he is just a simple human being with an amazing talent that he wants to share with the world. He plays mostly in smaller arenas so he can connect more with the crowd. If you are a fan of acoustic artists and small venues - then his concert is definitely for you.    I would highly recommend you go to Ed's concert even if you only know one song of his. He is absolutely amazing and his gigs are an incredible experience for everybody. ",1
Ed Sheeran,"I fell in love with Ed's music a few years ago, a little before the big hype about him (of which there is every need to be). I loved his first album and all his ""old"" songs (pre-+) like ones in The songs I wrote with Amy and X (Mulitply) is just even better.  I knew he would be amazing live, because any live lounges or live performances I've watched of his have been brilliant.  What I love is that it's just him, his guitar and his loop pedal – no band or back-up singers which is something quite unique to him. That, I think, makes a more personal connection with him and the crowd so, even parents who didn't particularly want to be there could be involved as well with clapping etc.  He seems really genuine and down-to-earth through his performances too as he doesn't have anything too flashy – just a couple screens behind him so everyone can see him. And of course, just jeans and a t-shirt.  He had a good mix of up-beat and slow songs and songs with a slow start and build up which I really liked. He also added things to the songs like adding other parts of songs to the end or adding an extra verse than from what's on the album (eg. You need me, I don't need you).  His love performance consisted mostly of songs from his new album, X but also many songs from + and a few older songs too like Gold Rush.  I was definitely recommend listening to and going to a concert of Ed's because his music is for everyone and he is definitely a crowd-pleaser. ",1
Ed Sheeran,"James Blunt was the opening act, with Ed Sheeran as the main.  The show started right on time, which doesn't always happen in my experience. Blunt had a hit with ""Beautiful"" in the states a while back and we haven't heard much from him since, so he poked fun at himself on stage and put on a great show. The crowd may have come to see Ed Sheeran, but Blunt set a great mood for the rest of the show, ending with an upbeat song.  He is the self proclaimed singer of ""miserable songs"", yet he ended his set on a positive note and crowd participation. Ed Sheeran's show started a bit after James Blunt's performance ended, 15 minutes maybe. As we already know, he's an incredibly gifted and talented artist. His set was beautiful, with a lot of graphics on the screens to go with the songs. I do wish that on some songs they'd shown him more on the big screens, since it's those of us sitting further back couldn't see him as well.  That's fine though, it was still worth it.  He ended with ""Shape of You"", which made our daughter very happy since she's not yet 9, that's one of her favorite songs, and this was her first concert. Tacoma Dome was the venue, the concert and venue were great, the parking and way out, not so much. It was a total cluster and $30 parking for an outdoor lot with no real direction is not good, in my opinion. If there was actual traffic control to help leaving the concert, it would have been perfect. That's my only gripe. ",1
Ed Sheeran,"Ed Sheeran is probably the most talented man alive, thought surprisingly not many people know about Ed Sheeran. He is a singer song writer with an incredible voice who stands on stage with a guitar and a loop pedal. He builds the music right in front of you, singing the background melodies and strumming the guitar until the music is perfect and than he starts singing his songs. This is my third time seeing Ed Sheeran, and it won't be my last. The ""Ginger Jesus"" as many fans call him opened with ""I'm a Mess"" which is one of my personal favorites. He continued building beats and playing my favorite songs throughout the whole night and there was never a boring moment. Another personal favorite is when Ed (he's soo cute) requests the crowd to be completely silent, no singing, NO SCREAMING, and no talking. Eventually the crowd quiets down and everyone is shushing each other while he beautifully sings ""Afire Love"" which is a song he wrote in tribute to his grandfather. The concert went by so fast and we were suddenly chanting for ""More Ed"". Naturally, he came back and gave us the most incredible performance I have ever seen in my life singing ""You Need Me, I Don't Need You"" I can't even describe it. Of course he sang A-Team, which is such a beautiful song and ""Sing"". Ed Sheeran is so humble and honestly, one of the most talented people of our generation. ",1
Ed Sheeran,"It takes a lot of talent to make grown men squeal like teenage girls at a concert but Ed Sheeran did just that.   From the second he walks on stage the energy in the room changes. From first sight of that ginger hair the entire crowd went insane. The relation between the venue size and the amount of noise that was being produced was astounding. However, his cool presence can also make an entire room go silent. It takes true talent to quiet a room of teenage girls.    On the other hand, the audience that his music appeals to was various. Although I arrived at 7:30 am for the general admission show (which started at 7pm) there were also many older fans and an almost even ration of male to female.   You can tell by his expressions ( and the countless ""thank-you's) that Ed is truly grateful to be where he is today. The way he gets the crowd involved is unbelievable. He has them sing the back up vocals while he plays the loop pedal and sings lead. This one man can create the sounds of an entire band. At various times throughout the show I stopped singing along just to hear his amazing voice and take in what was actually happening in front of my eyes.   Closing the show with his latest hit ""Sing"", he left the crowd singing all the way into their cars. Never have I seen such a genuine performer with such talent. X. ",1
Ed Sheeran,"After seeing Ed live, I've fallen 100 times more in love with him. Wembley Stadium is a big place so I was initially concerned that my seat was too far away from all the excitement (as it was in the back half of the stadium and highest level of assigned seating) however I was grateful to find this was wrong as Sheeran's stage presence captured the entire stadium. His warm up acts- Foy Vance and One Republic- were also brilliant. One of the first things Sheeran said upon coming onto the stage was that no one cares what you're doing so dance like crazy and everyone has to lose their voice by the end of the show; despite the size of his audience, it was comforting to be spoken to almost as an individual. Many of his songs had a faster tempo than recorded on the CD which made them far more exciting, for example, one of my favourites, 'I'm a mess'. He gave an emotional performance of 'Afire love' from his second album for which he introduced as a ""very personal (song) to (him)"". I think many people connect more to artists like Sheeran because of the whole-heartedness and sincerity of his shows. I'm embarrassingly jealous of fans who are seeing him over the next few nights and I'm keen to get tickets for his next tour (providing he brings out another smash of an album- who am I kidding of course he will) ",1
Ed Sheeran,"I'm so glad I went to see Ed Sheeran perform live! I'd watched a couple of videos on Youtube of past concerts, so I knew that he would put on a good show, but it was better than I even expected. The people in the row behind me were very confused as the time neared for Ed to go on, commenting that the stage was still fairly empty of equipment-- All of the audio during the show comes from his voice, his acoustic guitars (which get swapped out between songs, presumably to replace strings), and loop pedals, which is amazing. Setting up the layers for each song was seamlessly integrated into the performance. Visuals on moving screens behind him were a perfect backdrop/tie-in to the music, organically integrating live footage of Ed on stage with color, animated graphics and excerpts from his music videos, and the stage lighting was effectively atmospheric. Ed's singing voice and vocal gymnastics during his raps are flawless, as were his medleys of his own songs and covers, which are a lot of fun. You can tell from his exuberance that he loves performing and having the crowd sing along, which happened on nearly every song. I was legitimately losing my voice near the end XD The overall energy of the performance was fantastic and absolutely worth going to see this immense talent on stage! ",1
Ed Sheeran,"Well, I'm french so I apologize for my bad English. My friend and I have been waited for 5 months to see him and we were absolutely not disappointed. The concert began with Ryan Keen , who is extremely talented with his guitar. I really liked it. After he finished we waited 30mn Ed Sheeran..... And here he is. This cutie ginger with his guitar started to sing I'm Mess, and at this moment everybody moved their hands in the air and screaming and blah blah blah. I was a little surprised by one thing; I always see Ed during his shows anywhere asking to the audience to be quiet. Even when it was a TV show, buuut most of the time during this concert, he said to us ""Sing with me .... Don't stop..... Keep the rhythm.....etc,etc"" So it was pretty cool to show him that we know his lyrics, to show our support and love. Eventough I think it is much cooler to let him sing, let him drives you anywhere with his INCREDIBLE voice ,I have to say. Just looking at him and think Damn he is a good singer and moved me by his sensibility and honesty in his voice and songs. Words which describe this show could be simple but effective, Honest, generous, human, and talented. I will see him again, that's for sure. And I recommend to see him live, it is better. xx ",1
Ed Sheeran,"Small intimate venue for a special night with Ed Sheeran. Enjoyed the warm-up DJ and how he mixed well-known tunes together. Mahalia (support act) had a great voice that entertained us before the main man took to the stage. Ed treated us to a mixture of songs from his 3 albums. Castle on the Hill was a great start. Galway Girl, Nancy Mulligan & You Need Me, I Don’t Need You were other stand out tracks & I was so glad he responded to the audience request for Barcelona. He kept us entertained with stories & his energy and played almost a 2 hour set right up to curfew at 11pm - in fact he wasn’t able to finish with Sing as I would have expected. The only downsides - the cloakroom was not open as we came in. I was told it would be open when everyone was in the venue - my wife is only 5’2” tall (I’m 6’2) so she struggles to see at gigs. People in front of her recording whole songs impacted her ability to see - We found a spot near the sound desk. In quieter moments of Ed’s set we could hear bottles being thrown into recycle bins by bar staff at bar behind us & loud chatter from around the bar. I can never understand why people pay to go to gigs and talk all the way through Overall though an amazing night ",0
Ed Sheeran,"Ed Sheeran is an amazing entertainer. He possesses the rare ability to stand alone on a stage in front of thousands with just a guitar, microphone, and looping station. He travels lightly, requiring no band or moving stage parts. His intricate melodies are never the same in two shows. Sheeran mashes songs up, sneaks in a classic or two, and incorporates lyrics from current hits. He constantly keeps his fans engaged, giving them harmony parts to repeat, and even gets chaperoning parents tapping their feet to the beat. The diversity of the Suffolk singer's fans is incredible, ranging from fangirling tweens to accompanying husbands and boyfriends who do not initially expect to enjoy the event. ""The Man"" is a musical genius, able to easily transition from a quiet love song to an exhilerating rap, leaving the room ""Drunk"" with anticipation for what is coming next. He can please a crowd just as well as, if not better than, a seasoned performer with a full band, props, and costumes. Most amazingly, he remains humble and true to his roots, a normal twenty-four year old, refusing to let the fame go to his head. Sheeran paints a picture that is most definitely worth witnessing. ",1
Ed Sheeran,"It has been an incredible show! It was my first concert, I didn't know that this could such a great emotion to feel under the skin. My heart had an earthquake literally,it was that kind of emotion that rips out your soul and sews it with new pieces filled with that music that has conquered your everything. Ed Sheeran has an incredible voice, he's an angel on this earth and, with his wings, he generates the will to fly. I've been lucky for having the possibility to go to his concert and it has been and always will be the best event of this year and my life. Anytime now that I listen to his songs, I cry, but those tears are filled with happiness. It's been the first time in my life that I wept with joy! I'm not a lukcy girl and, for once in my life, I felt so well and I still feel well, I feel that, from now on, everything will be okay.This concert changed my life, Ed Sheeran saved me! Ed Sheeran is a superhero for me, he has the power to make people believe that this Earth is the most beautiful place to belong to. He'll be for eva in my heart, every beat has a musical note of his songs, his music pumps in my bloodstream, he's perfect to me! ",1
Ed Sheeran,"Ed Sheeran at Wembley was absolutely incredible. I have no words to describe how much fun me and my boyfriend had. Starting from the fact that both of his opening acts, Jamie Lawson and Anne-Marie, were both amazing and full of energy, I think the capacity that Ed has of putting on a show in front of 100,000 people with only his voice and his guitar are beyond words. Even though I was a tad disappointed because there was not a special guest, differently from the nights before where Stormzy and Andrea Bocelli joined on stage, I had a great time and sang and danced to every song. Ed was very interactive and we all had a laugh when he made jokes and it was nice to see how passionate he is when he performs. He genuinely wants every single person to have a good time and spend those couple of hours with a constant smile on the face. I felt a bit emotional when he sang some songs like Lego House or Photograph, and I danced and jumped during Nancy Mulligan. I am very grateful for getting to see him, especially on such a massive tour. Definitely would recommend to anyone and would see him again any time! 18/06/2018 - Giulia Tramontana ",1
Ed Sheeran,"Hi, my name is Bianca and I am here to tell you about my experience at Divide Tour Brazil in Belo Horizonte. I've never imagine that one day, Ed could came to BH, so when it was announced the dates for the tour in Brazil and the name of the city where I live was on the list, I was in shock, I cried and cried because I knew, at that moment, that I could not let go. 82 days of waiting since the purchase of the ticket, much anxiety and animation. Finally 05/30/2017, one of the best day of my life. I fulfilled the dream of going to the most cute redhead, show I've ever met. When he came on stage, it seemed like the floor would collapse, the audience would scream, sing and jump a lot, we were lucky to have Give Me Love on the setlist and it was wonderful. I have no words to describe what I felt at the moment, I know it was a mixture of sadness, knowing that it would end, and happiness, knowing that I was there, fulfilling one of my dreams. I just wanna thank Ed for the wonderful experience and for the show. I really hope that he come back very soon, I already miss him, hahaha. That was my Ed's concert experience! ",1
Bruno Mars,"I went to a Bruno Mars concert last night, and I thought it was great. When I first got there, everyone was really hyped up and excited, and the mood was contagious. The merchandise were cool, though it was very expensive (but what else do you expect at a concert?). Aloe Blacc went on before Bruno and sang some of his famous songs, and later came out to sign autographs.  When Bruno finally came out, he did so with a big bang (literally, it sounded like a gunshot). Throughout the concert, he remained energetic, and would  also stop every once in a while to talk to the audience. He made the audience feel like he was glad to be there and was having a good time with us.   Bruno Mars' sings many types of genres, including pop, reggae, soul, R&B, and pop rock. He has many different and original songs, one about getting his money stolen to another upbeat song about being lazy. Some of his more recent songs have a few cuss words, for example his song Gorilla. He made sure to sing the songs with cuss words toward the end of the concert, when all of the younger kids would have most likely left already. He actually surprised the audience quite a bit with this. He had a fake ending; said goodnight and thank you for coming, and 5 minutes later came back out and sang some of his expletive songs.  Overall I loved this concert, and I highly recommend you go too! ",1
Bruno Mars,"There is no doubt that Bruno Mars is one of the top male singers today. And if you haven't been to see him in concert, you're really missing out. His live performances are extremely entertaining. Many people don't realise that he's more than just a singer: his dance moves are smooth, and when he plays a drum solo, the girls cannot stop screaming! Honestly, you would think he was famous for his drum playing because he is just that good. Bruno Mars is very talented. He's also easy on the eyes ;) He's good looking and he usually wears a James Brown-type style suit which is very fitting since he dances like James Brown too. You can't help but dance along when he's performing “Runaway”, or to sing along when he's performing “Just The Way You Are”. Also, his band is perfect: when they're backing him up, there is so much energy.  He keeps it simple while giving a performance of a lifetime, no matter what the event is. Bruno Mars' live performances make me happy. I love him and I love how talented he is. He gives his performances his all, and never disappoints. When he's done, you can't help but to give him a standing ovation and beg for more. Once the concert is over, you can bet you're going to go home and listen to Bruno Mars even more. ",1
Bruno Mars,"The Bruno Mars concert was seriously phonominal. He is such a great performer and a great singer. He's so so so good live. Him and the hooligans are amazing. They're really funny and they dance a lot and it's so good! I really think that man can do anything and pull it off. If you go to the concert you will not regret or forget it. It's so memorable and such a great time. There are lots of suprizes during the whole concert and it really keeps you on your feet. He's amazing and if he ever comes back to my city or anywhere near it I'm going to be there. He did a variety of different songs. He did reggae, his slow songs, his faster songs (like Natalie, Gorilla, etc). He even covered some songs (like bump and grind and other classics) he didn't sing the whole songs but he did the best parts of the songs he covered and mixed it together. It's very hard to explain but that was very memorable. There was singing, fire, glitter confetti, dancing, Bruno Mars and the Hooligans... What else could you want? Did you know in Honolulu Hawaii where 'Bruno' was born as 'Peter Gene Bayot Hernandez'? Hope you go to the 'Moonshine Jungle Tour because it's amazing! Have fun! ",1
Bruno Mars,"Overall, the Bruno Mars concert was an incredible experience. The fact that he could sing like a dove, play a mean guitar lick, AND dance his pants off - all at the same time - blew me away. I was kept entertained all night long. The great thing about Bruno's set is that although it was short and focuses mostly on his most recent album, it was the most diverse set I've ever seen performed at a concert; from covers to original songs, Bruno sang pop, rock, disco, doo-wop, R&B, hip-hop, reggae, and soul, delivering every genre with the same vigor and excitement. The next best thing about the concert besides Bruno himself was his band, the Hooligans. Not only were they talented singers and performers, but also they also danced and laughed with Bruno like old buddies, making the concert seem much more like an intimate gig with friends. Basically, GO SEE HIM! You'll dance, you'll laugh, and hey, you might even cry during the ballads. So GO and find out! :) ",1
Bruno Mars,"This concert was perhaps one of the best concerts I've been to and that says a lot since I just turned 59 and 365 days (it's still difficult for me to admit that I'm X0 years old.... I saw Jimmie Hendrix in concert, Moody Blues, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, Cream, Miranda Lambert, Lady Antebellum, Jason Aldean, Siberian Orchestra, Johnny Mathis and many many more artists and this concert ranked in the top 5. The dancing was fantastic, his stage presence and how he played with the crowd (mostly the ladies) was FUN!!!!  His drum solo-words cannot describe it... I only wish I could see him tonight in Milwaukee (I live in Wisconsin) at Summerfest tonight.  I would go again to see him....Aloe Blacc was great also!!!!! Thanks for asking. ",1
Bruno Mars,"The Bruno Mars concert was amazing! The only fault that I would say is that there was a lot of waiting Dua Lipa was right on time and it felt like when’s Bruno coming?! Then after Dua Lipa we had to wait for them to set Bruno up which felt like forever, but when he was out there it was amazing he had fireworks and amazing dance moves and his singing was just amazing. He even added some comedy in there, and he was putting his absolute all you could see by the sweat on his body. After we thought it was over but he surprised us with an extra song :) it was an experience of a lifetime and I must say for my first concert it was A M A Z I N G ! For the merchandise I feel some of it was just a bit overpriced like the hats. ",1
Bruno Mars,"I spent $256 on a ticket and flew from Florida to Las Vegas to see this fiasco of a show. The show was supposed to start at 9. The curtain finally rose at almost 9:30. The drums and bass were so loud, little of the vocals could be heard. The band was off several times, there was limited choreography, 2 solos (drum and piano, neither of which were Bruno, OBVIOUS TIME FILLERS), and the show lasted one hour and 15 minutes. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!!! IT SUCKED!! I am used to hearing songs sung at concerts, not stopped mid-way to laugh and joke. Bruno Mars needs to go to some REAL concerts so he can see how to please his PAYING AUDIENCE. Go get some lessons from Pink, Elton John, who ever, Bruno, cause your show is a joke!! ",-1
Bruno Mars,"It was an absolutely amazing night! The performance was stunning and the atmosphere was filled with laughter and happiness. Bruno Mars did an incredible job, by making sure everybody was having a party, and you could just see how much he loved standing on that scene and singing to the crowd. Also I am not going to forget Anderson.Paak who played just before Bruno went on stage. Andersson.Paak made sure, that everyone were ready for the big party, and he too is an incredible musician. Bruno Mars even learned how to say ""I love you"" in danish, which made us feel even closer to him. I will never forget this night! ",1
Bruno Mars,"It was awesome!!!!! Bebe Rexha was there and Nick Jonas and who we were all waiting for BRUNO MARSSSS!!! I was soooo happy when Nick Jonas sang one of his songs from Camp Rock!!!! Bebe Rexha sang Me, Myself, and I, I love that song!!! I just think it wasn’t necessary to say some bad words while she spoke, but thats ok because it’s BEBE REXHA!!! Bruno Mars was I-N-C-R-E-D-I-B-L-E!!!!! He sang all of my favorite songssss and ne sang UPTOWN FUNK!!!! AWESOME!!!! Overall, it was the best concert of my life, even though we could have been in better seats, and I even got a souvenir t-shirt!!!! ",1
Bruno Mars,The concert was AWESOME! The opening person was really good and did a lot with the audience. She talked to the people not as a pop star but as a person. Her song choices really set the mood and went from sad songs to happy songs and did a outstanding job. For Bruno Mars him self did super good. His back up people were an awesome addition to the show. The record thing was a really cool idea. The show was a little delayed because it didn't start until like 15 after 8. Other than that the show was awesome and set the bar very high for the people after him. love you Bruno Mars ,1
Bruno Mars,"The show was good....not great. The tickets were pretty expensive....$200 for the nose bleed seats. The show lasted exactly one hour. I expected more. Don't get me wrong, I was entertained, but I went to see Bruno Mars because I wanted to be blown away. I wasn't. Also, the opening act was Charlie Wilson....not a fan of his so I felt like half money was wasted. When he annouched that Ciara would be opening, I was like yes!! But she didn't. That was pretty disappointing. But like I said, the show was good, but it could have been way better. ",-1
Bruno Mars,"Good things are: Saw him at the Park Theater, MonteCarlo, in Las Vegas--had great seats & my favorite venue. Love Bruno Mars, love his songs. He's a great singer, writer & producer. The energy in the venue was so alive & enjoyed it very much. Bad things were: in some songs, his voice was being drowned by the instrumental process, his guys's dance routines needed to be more in unison & his pyrotechnics sounded like M-80s at someone's back yard. OTHERWISE, loved the show! ",0
Bruno Mars,"I could see well in the front row of the arena standing, but because of the standing I had a close contact with people around me, I never thought that I would not like the standing seat. The show was awesome. His voice was very nice, and the members were also the highest peak. It was truly a level high. It is an artist who wants to go again. Next time I would like to see a show overseas. It will be different from Japan. ",1
Bruno Mars,"Showmanship = On Point Costumes, lighting, spectacle! - Big, bright and wonderful to look at! Vocal ability and clarity= Pitch perfect, crystal clear, simply sublime Dance and movement = A+++++ Very pleased that I made the effort to see this man and his band (came all the way from Trinidad) Only love to you and hooligans, Bruno! Only Love. P.S. Serious withdrawal symptoms on this rainy Monday!! DL ",1
Bruno Mars,"Bruno mars is absolutely amazing.  He is the most talented artist I've ever seen in concert.  Not only can he sing, he can dance,  play guitar and drums.  His band is amazing too, they were dancing with him!  He interacted with the audience and really put on an amazing show,  rather then just lip-singing every song. His performance on stage last night was extraordinary,  and I would love to see him again. ",1
Bruno Mars,"This is the 6th time I have seen him. The difference with this concert was that it was in an open air stadium. The lighting system and fireworks, added to the exitement. The public were good , he was well received. As usual the show was fantadtic. The repetoire of songs, the dancing and the rapport with the public. He is the greatestand I cannot eait until the next time. I hope its soon again in europe. ",1
Bruno Mars,"Bruno as expected was amazing, other than starting 25minutes late he did not disappoint, a true entertainer. His dance sequences were spot on, he is a mix of James Brown, Prince, Morris Day and the Time. And the Hooligans were right along with him, the song would start and Hooligans would start dancing and he would seamlessly mix in and out with them. A perfect New Year Eve event would see him again. ",1
Bruno Mars,This concert surpassed all expectations. The whole group were amazing . They all danced from the start to the finish of the concert and that took some doing while playing instruments. Bruno Mars was amazing. He has got fantastic stage presence to start with but has a startling voice. He is a very talented performer. People were on their feet for most of the concert.an exilerating experience. WOW!!! ,1
Bruno Mars,"In a word: totally and utterly 'awesome' He's a unrivalled gifted artist, an entertainer beyond words, his whole band and crew are in a league of their own - but this tour - wow oh wow oh wow........the stage. What an incredibly show. That takes creativity, showmanship, planning beyond belief I imagine Once in a lifetime display of talent and technology. Enjoyed every single second. ",1
Bruno Mars,"Simply put it was amazing, great, outstanding. The demographics of who attends ranges for a six year old to 80 year old grandma and grandpa's. Families, friends of all ages were in attendance. I never saw Michael Jackson, Prince, Freddie Mercury and what not in their prime, but man, I just saw Bruno Mars certainly in his and hopefully for many years to come. ",1
Kanye West,"I gotta give it to Yeezus. He's still got the juice and for him to pack the 'Bowl' while performing a seven year old album is a testament to that fact. Show started an hour late and I had the feeling there would be some tech glitches, but you definitely couldn't hate on the effort. There was a small orchestra section stage right and on stage left what appeared to be a few DJ's and dudes on drum machines. The center of the stage featured 3 grand white staircases that were reconfigured between songs. There were fireworks at times which didn't quite fit the tone of the album, but who doesn't like fireworks. It was a party atmosphere and I felt a real connection with other fans simply based on the fact that WE LOVE THIS FUCKING ALBUM. We sang, we yelled, we danced, we laughed, and we reminisced about a Kanye that took us back to bring us forward. Most memorable moments: Staircases rotate to reveal 60 or so black men in rags and covered in dust. Very striking visual that reminded me of a slave ship. He used what I'll call ""human props"" throughout the show, but I felt like this moment resonated most. Jeezy came out for Amazing, but the tech was ALL CHEWED UP. Sound was cutting in and out, poor lighting, pianist was even confused at one point. At one point Kanye states that this performance is actually more of a dress rehearsal. I figured as much and even debated going to the Saturday show, but there was something about the rawness of an opening night that I wanted to be part of. I'm sure Saturday's show will be way more on point. ",1
Kanye West,"I have never been a person who could pinpoint a moment in which divine providence had played some role in my life. That is, until I saw Kanye. Watching Kanye West perform is a wholly religious experience. Someone you don't know and can barely see is instructing you to complete strange actions which seem nonsensical, like throwing your hands in there or singing lyrics or pointing your middle finger to the sky. Yet, you follow along. You are surrounded by thousands of people who share similar beliefs and interests as you. Everything is ridiculous expensive and you must pay your way in. Kanye comes out pretty much an hour late, just because he can. When he finally emerges, it is on a platform suspended in the air. The platform rocks to and fro during the concert, bouncing right above the general admissions mosh pit. It is those in the mosh pit who are the most blessed. They seem positively energized by Kanye, dancing and thrashing for two hours straight. When Kanye finishes his act, he performs ""Ultralight Beam"". Towards the end of the show, his platform lowers and he steps down onto the ground, showing us that the man we had seemingly worshiped with our screams and our expressions of adulation walks on the same ground we do. And maybe it was the weed smoke, or maybe the sheer excitement, but as I was swaying to the music, I felt a connection to a higher power, something greater than myself. It was a moment of absolute perfection where I didn't feel alone and hopeless in the world. ",1
Kanye West,"Whether his messianic stature is bona fide or self-professed, one thing’s still for certain: an evening with Kanye West will blow your freaking mind. Love him or loathe him, there are number of things we say about ‘Ye for certain. The guy boasts a repertoire of hits hotter than Seth Rogen’s motorcycle seat. This is a guy with the talent to dethrone his mentor, with the vision to produce the totally unexpected, and with the ego to say and do exactly what he wants. All in all, those ingredients synthesise to produce the greatest live music experience on offer in the modern age. Hands down. However it’s what we can’t say for certain about West that polarises crowds the world over. The rants, the fights, the Jesus lookalikes; to some extent, it’s no great surprise that the rapper has found himself at loggerheads with audiences on multiple occasions. But if that’s the price we have to pay to accept this visionary into our lives, then show me where to sign. When Kanye delivers, he arrives first class. “One of the greatest hip-hop sets of all time”, so said the Hollywood Reporter of Coachella 2011. “I am so credible and so influential and so relevant that I will change things”, so said Kanye of himself. Hear, hear, Mr. West. ",1
Kanye West,"The sounds of hydraulic machinery filled Oracle Arena, as the stench of dirt weed mingled with the faux fog that had been pumping into the air over the past two hours. The opening samples of “Father Stretch My Hands Pt. 1” were slowed down and turned elastic, thus leaving alien chemtrails of sound in the wake of the shadowy figure tethered to the hovering spacecraft. With heads upturned in anticipation of first contact, the crowd was lost in darkness. Chants of “Kan-ye! Kan-ye!” filled every empty space, until the object of their affection shone his light down on the chosen few. The party-sized hoverboard had traversed the entire length of the arena (from a height of about 10 feet above the tallest head), before blasting spotlights on those below; instantly creating the largest circle pit a hip-hop tour has ever seen. “Just wanna feel liberated, I, I, I…” Kanye West had arrived in Oakland, and while many outside the venue failed to understand the appeal, those who had been waiting patiently (well past start time) were losing their collective mind.

Kanye West,"Kanye was a lot more humble than I expected. I've always loved a lot of the lyrics of his songs as they speak about real stuff that's going on, like the media covering up on what's actually important and people higher up trying to make everyone conform.  His concert was better than I thought it would be. He was entertaining, interactive with the crowd, tried to get the people on the floor to start a mosh pit (haha) and he talked about some shit in the media against him that wasn't true.  The massive screen thing he had happening put an interesting twist to seeing Kanye as it was done in like negative colouring and you could only half see him a lot of the time, which was a bit frustrating but also added to the drama of him. I LOVED the freaky masks he wore half the time, very Kanye- all that bling.  He played a good mix of his music from a bunch of new stuff right back to the older stuff. Almost the whole seated crowd were standing the whole time (something I've NEVER seen at a concert)  I have a newfound respect for Kanye West and am really happy I finally got to see him. I'd definitely go back ",1
Kanye West,"it was fucking horrible as shit like really kanye? i, as well as everyone else who came to see your show in sacramento, were so hyped. it was literally going to be the highlight of my thanksgiving break. i bought your tickets for $70 as well as a shirt for $20, only for you to show up AN HOUR AND A HALF LATE, perform three songs that you didn't even finish, and to listen to your inaccurate rant about politics. honestly man, i respected you so much as an artist; you were and still are a musical genius and i will forever support your music career, but i lost all respect for you as a person yesterday. you disrespected your fans last night, who have been nothing but loyal to you throughout your career. that was a real shitty move, and to be honest with you man, i feel sorry for you. the money so up in your mind that you don't know who you are anymore. we miss the old kanye the socially woke kanye the finish the show kanye we hate the new kanye walk off the stage kanye the hella fake kanye...

Kanye West,"The Saint Pablo Tour was by far the dopest energy in one place that I have felt at a venue the size of Verizon Center.  The stage was suspended in air and the attendees with floor seats were actually a mosh pit! They stood the entire time fueling the energy as he floated above their heads and out stretched arms.  Everyone in the building stood the entire concert. Everyone.  Though the lights were dim and the big screen had an hallucination type effect, the lyrics and his movement came thru with Kanye precision. I had the time of my life at this concert. The cherry on the top was that I was invited as a surprise from my love.  The hands down best surprise I've ever received!! I love the old Kanye.  I love the new Kanye. I love Kanye. Period. ",1
Kanye West,"Soooooo, about that concert last night... KANYE IS A BEAST! No matter how completely NUTZ he his, his talents can not be denied! The subliminal messages of his setup were incredible... *smokey, ethereal environment *floating stage that moved from END-to-END *image on screen was always in a ghostly/God-like projection *he was always looking down at his ""followers"" He's INSANE but he managed to entertain by spewing HIT AFTER HIT! I would have preferred more lighting b/c we did pay to SEE him & I wasn't really interested in his GODLY presentation. BUT, the arena was almost packed & he has another show tonight. He's #winning ",1
Kanye West,"What can I say about probably the most talked about person in the media? This concert first off, was more of a staging experience but that definitely doesn't mean it's a bad thing at all.  In fact, Mr. West creates this unique experience that no other artist has pulled off before with the lights accompanying this man's vast array of hits that can easily move any crowd to do his bidding, overall if you ever see him town, save up what you have and experience this tour before it ends. ",1
Kanye West,"Lit show. He's so great because he didn't need back up, the show was solely him and it was still fire. Some cool lighting but that's it. He spit fire!!! Timing: started 9:20- doors opened at 6, was supposed to start at 8. He had no opening act. Ended around 10:45. Didn't seem long enough lol No background vocals, no background dancers. A lot of of his songs played in the background with him on top. Was actually really smooth Ultralight beam finished the night which was heavenly ",0
Kanye West,"The show was absolutely insane.  I had floor seat, which are a must for the best experience.  The lighting made the whole place seen unreal and magical...  Seeing Kanye West up close to the point where I was right under him in a mosh pit.  The forum venue is great and a perfect size in my opinion.  By far one of the best experiences of my life and for sure the best concert.  Well worth the money for floor seats and I'd pay for it all over again if I could. ",1
Kanye West,"Had to say a really great experience seeing Kanye live. I felt the vibe that he had in his music upfront and personal then listening to his songs on the radio or through my phone. The lights and the moving stage above the people in GA was really well done. Even though it hasn't been the only concert I been to, it was probably the only one I've been to that had the stage move with Kanye on it. Pretty dope! Lots of fun! ",1
Kanye West,"Amazing show! The greatest concert I've ever been too! The set list took something from just about every album! And his interactions with the fans was incredible. I can tell he really loved his fans, and the city (Sacramento) loved him right back! He played a little bit to long (almost thirty minutes), but that's okay. I was expecting to have long night anyway. Great job! ",1
Kanye West,"Kanye's concert was amazing from the beginning to end! The lights and special effects were great and he got the crowd involved. He sang older songs as well as new. Half way through the show, he spoke to fans about following your dreams and never giving up, which was inspiring. Definitely an artist I would go and see live again! ",1
Kanye West,"You can tell he doesn't like to sing his hits. He played niggas in Paris and sang about 5 words of it, while he walked around on stage. Same with all of the lights and power. Great show though. The life of pablo album felt like it was made with the show in mind. Excellent showmanship. Tons of fog, lights and lasers. ",1
Kanye West,Couldn't have been a better show. Music was loud and bumping people were chilling having a good time and Travis Scott made the most of running throught the crowd once or twice. And over a 10/10 show the new stage idea was kinda hard to get used to but either way was really cool to see Kanye as close as he really got ,1
Kanye West,"Amazing performance by an amazing artist, had so much fun ! Even my friend, who barely knew any of the lyrics, said she has the time of her life :) Amazing outfit, fabulous setlist and the performance was lit, couldnt stop dancing and shouting my throat and legs hurt but totally worth both the money and the pain ",1
Kanye West,"Worse concert ever! Kanye was 1.5 hours late. Only three songs performed. One of those songs was performed twice. Then, there was 30 minutes of Kanye ranting. Then, the show was over. I am a huge fan of Kanye. This was my first and last Kanye concert.  I was very disappointed and upset. Our tickets costed $688. ",-1
Kanye West,"This was one of the best concerts I've been too, definitely in my top 5 this year. Despite the 80 min late start, he played for almost 2 hours on a floating stage. Low lights, dim, nothing but Kanye! His set was super amped, he got us all going no matter where u sat; nobody was seated. Loved it!! ",1
U2,"What makes a U2 concert so special? What is it about a U2 show that compels us to travel hundreds and thousands of miles to see virtually the same concert over and over? A U2 show is more than just the songs in the concert. It is the feeling you get when you hear those songs. Whether they lift you up or remind you of a special time in your life, either way, the feeling you get when you hear U2 songs is euphoric. But a U2 concert is more than just those euphoric songs that are played. It is 80,000 people singing those songs together. The fact that each person at that show is feeling the exact same excitement you are. It is a sense of community and belonging. More than just the U2 concert itself, it is the whole experience. The traveling and hanging out with fellow U2 fans. The day of the U2 concert is a great time for U2 fellowship since we arrive at the stadium in the early afternoon either to line up in the GA (general admission) line or to wait for Bono, Larry, Edge and Adam to arrive. With many hours to kill before the concert begins, U2 fans share their U2 experiences, such as favorite songs, albums and concerts. My favorite U2 concert, of the 75 I have seen, was on the Elevation Tour in Providence, Rhode Island on October 31, 2001. It was my favorite U2 member's 40th birthday, drummer Larry Mullen Jr. It was the night Larry and I shared a drink. The morning of the show, I woke up outside around 8am – pretty good sleeping outside in 30 degrees for five hours. I went up to the warm hotel room until about 10am, then had some breakfast. I stayed in the GA line all day without leaving, except to take a shower around 3:30. I got everyone in the GA line to sign the big orange birthday card I made for Larry. I put my name and email address on the back just in case. The band didn’t arrive until after we were inside. Wearing our Larry Mullen Band shirts, we got our spots at the rail up front and center between Bono and Adam. I held up my birthday card for Larry as they walked on stage, but he didn’t notice it. There were many, many signs including one saying, ‘Bono let Larry sing.’ During Elevation, Bono sang, ‘ Celebration’ then said, ‘Happy Birthday.' After ""Stuck in a Moment,"" Larry’s 40th birthday celebration began. We sang ""Happy Birthday"" to Larry. A birthday cake was brought out, and Larry pretended to throw it out into the audience. Larry took the mic and came to the front to talk while Bono sat behind the drums. Larry said, ""Bono can’t play drums. It took me 40 years to get up front. I’m glad I’m spending my birthday with 18,000 of my closest friends. I feel like I could borrow money from you."" Then Bono asked for a bottle of champagne, which he shook up a la ZooTV and sprayed the audience. Edge took a swig, then Larry drank and continued to drink for the next few songs. After ""Kite,"" Larry got off the drums and made a B line for me. I got my card and shirt in hand so I could give it to him, but that’s not why he was there. He gave me the champagne bottle – with champagne still in it. I drank some and shared it with my friends. Larry wanted to share his birthday with ME! He wanted ME to have a drink on his birthday. I was SO excited I didn’t even realize they played ""Wild Honey,"" which they rarely play. After ""Pride,"" Larry came back over to me so I could give him the birthday card and Elvis tee shirt. I said, ""Thank you. Happy Birthday."" He smiled and said, ""Thank You."" Later on, Bono noticed our Larry Mullen Band shirts, shook his head and smiled. I doubt there will ever be another U2 show like that night in Providence. Granted it was Larry’s 40th Birthday, and I love Larry, but also for the rarities U2 played that night. ""Slow Dancing"" was played for the first time on the Elevation tour, and only the 11th time ever. ""Party Girl"" and ""Wild Honey"" were played for the first time on that leg of Elevation – and I’ve only heard those songs a couple of times ever. There was just a great energy in Providence that night. I still have that champagne bottle that Larry gave me on his 40th birthday. ",1
U2,"Bom dia, Acompanho a Banda desde 1985, na época dos disco long play ou compacto e meu primeiro álbum, o primeiro disco que comprei foi ""War"". Sempre soube o posicionamento social e político do grupo, penso ser o que me chamou a atenção e cativou desde o princípio.Mas aqui no Brasil, vivemos tempos difíceis, de beligerância e intolerância de diversas formas, racial, social,religiosa. Uma sociedade apolítica, mas que fundamenta suas crenças no que a imprensa local determina. Acredito que essa é a melhor Tour em que estive, visto ser minha segunda vez num show do U2. Estive em 2006, em Vertigo e mesmo passando por um momento delicado, pois estava tomando medicação para síndrome do pânico e depressão, saí do estádio 90% melhor do que quando cheguei. A atual turnê, é de uma dos melhores, se não a melhor, assim como o álbum do grupo e se pudesse iria em todas, Setilist fantástica, iluminação e palco minimalista e remetendo a uma simplicidade do inicio dos shows da Banda. Amei!!!!Parabéns e que venham muito mais........ ............................................... Good Morning, I accompany the band since 1985, in the days of long or compact disc and my first album, the first record I bought was ""War"". I have always known the social and political position of the group, I think it is what caught my attention and captivated me from the beginning. But here in Brazil, we live in difficult times, of belligerence and intolerance of diverse forms, racial, social, and religious. An apolitical society, but that bases its beliefs on what the local press determines. I think this is the best Tour I've been on, seeing it as my second time at a U2 show. I was in Vertigo in 2006 and even going through a delicate time, since I was taking medication for panic syndrome and depression, I left the stadium 90% better than when I arrived. The current tour is one of the best, if not the best, as well as the group's album and if it could go in all, fantastic Setilist, minimalist lighting and stage and referring to a simplicity of the beginning of the bands shows. Congratulations and many more ........ ",1
U2,"Great show, very basic staging, which is a nice change of pace for U2 recently. It allowed you to focus on them as a band, 4 guys playing music together. As a tour kick off, there will be some glitches and bugs, the worst of which is when The band and Bono totally flubbed the entire song With or Without You!!! The band was out of sync right from the start and that must have rattled Bono because he false started the first verse, got the lyrics wrong, then just stood there silent while the crowd sort of tried to chime in with the vocals. It was actually pretty awkward, and Bono didn't acknowledge it except by saying ""you guys can sing this one"". It was so great to see them actually play Joshua Tree straight through, track by track. I wasn't sure that's how it would really play out. As an album about the greatness, and hardships, of America, with inspiration from American music, landscapes, and especially politics, there was no way to get through the set without nods (mostly subtle - for U2) to the current leadership in America. The opening 8-9 songs before actually launching into Joshua Tree were pretty telling about the bands politics and values of freedom, truth, and fulfilling the American dream. The fact that opening night coincidentally fell on the 60th anniversary of the Martin Luther King ""Give Us the Vote"" speech gave more weight to lyrics referencing King's assassination in ""Pride (In the Name of Love)"". Finally, totally unrelated to Songkick or U2, but I have to say how HORRIBLE Levi's Stadium is and the whole process of getting there (unmanaged traffic), getting into the venue (no purses bigger than a cell phone allowed and no mention of that fact anywhere), getting food (seemed like only 25 people trying to sell hot dogs to 50,000!). Will never see another show there again no matter who the act is. ",1
U2,"This show needed to start and finish in darkness to concentrate the mind on the amazing imagery and truly iconic music. The lead in through tracks from Unforgettable Fire set the pace and raised the pulse rate to a crescendo at the onset of Where The Streets Have No Name where it remained at rates which would have set off many a hospital vital signs alarm until the end of the a play through of the entire Joshua Tree album. Had this concert finished there it would have sad to depart - and U2 knew this so included a further array of some of their finest tracks from the last 30 years. This was the trickiest period of the gig however, as not all of the next 35 - 40 minutes could match the standard set down by some of the best music of the 20th century. Moments of oddness crept in, as is Bono's way, and momentum was lost - not gained - towards the end. Ultimately, an incredible visionary onslaught and a truly mammoth rendition of One lifted the gig back to the heights of its earlier euphoria. This could easily have been the best concert I have ever seen, but on balance it dropped short. I would not have missed this for the world and I am sure I will look back in years to come and feel so pleased that I was there and saw what was a true moment in musical history. As it stands right now I have a mixed emotion... but there is no denying that of the many hundreds of concerts I have been to in the last 40 years this was right up there at the very pinnacle - a top ten bucket list moment.

U2,"U2 at Arrowhead Stadium in KC was a musical memory I'll put in my Top 10...so far.  We got parking lot passes from Ticketmaster beforehand to  save $$ & make navigating the throngs of traffic manageble.  We got to the lot about 5:30 p.m.  People had been there tailgating & the lot attendants were very organized, flagging us in to our spot. We immediately headed in to the Stadium so we could check out the U2 merchandise.  Entering was a breeze, even with security, because we had checked online to see what could or couldn't be taken into the Stadium.  The restrictions make lines move much quicker, even with entering through metal detectors.  Walking up the ramp to our seat level was easy.  U2 had merchandise areas set up at more locations, so lines there were less.  The concession places had very friendly attendants.  The stadium seats were very comfortable.  Security was there in abundance & were also helpful & friendly.  Concert acoustics for an open stadium were amazing.  The only downside was the placement of the audio towers or whatever they were, but they were necessary to provide the incredible U2 audio & visual experience.  After the concert, we waited for an hour on purpose before exiting to avoid sitting in traffic, idling.  Again, smooth exit.  So I highly recommend seeing U2 for their musical talent, their political message & celebrating the 4th anniversary of the Joshua Tree album.  ENJOY! ",1
U2,"U2 are a band who have conquered the globe and are considered iconic by fans of most genres. With such staggering reputation it is obviously quite difficult to form a live show of equal stature. Luckily, Bono and co obtain a form of bravado that is required of any iconic band. The key component of their gigs is that they understand how important and dear the audience hold tracks such as 'With Or Without You' and the intense sincerity in which they perform could not be more appropriate. There is an ethereal state when thousands upon thousands are singing along to 'The Streets Have No Name' whilst four musicians command the entire crowd. There is no denying Bono performs with the same level of self-assuredness that he conducts himself in daily life yet when the opening bars of 'Pride' begin, this level of bombast is required to tackle these gargantuan anthems. They have an impossible amount of hits to choose from, yet the setlist feels well calculated and not simply a 'greatest hits' compilation. The use of snippets of their own music and classics by the likes of Bowie turned their gig from a concert into a musical celebration. ",1
U2,"The concert was awesome but the venue was absolute crap!!!!! Paid $264.00 x 2 & a tower was blocking the view depending where the band was standing on the stage. So view blocked. Support act Noel Gallagher couldn’t hear him speak, don’t know what he was saying & sound not too good at all. U2 came on & could hardly see them. GA would have been better & cheaper & from what Ive heard, they had the best place to hear. SCG is not a good venue for a concert & we were so totally disappointed with what we paid, seating & going to ground & trying so squeeze through the line ups for toilets & good to get to the Merchandise shop. Then trying to get back up to level 5. Please never put a concert there again, unless you our stage in centre, so everyone can see. You shouldn’t charge extreme prices for crap seating. U2 was awesome as always but couldn’t always see them & at times hear them, the sound got better as the night went on. Definitely very disappointed with SCG ",0
U2,"Amazing concert as always. Lot of security at the entrances so it was a little bit slow everything and I was afraid because maybe I couldn't watch Noel Gallagher but organization was clever and started one hour later more or less. Really it was very difficult to be there at 19 with that security level. But everything was perfect. Noel played lot of Oasis songs with classics like Wonderwall, Little by Little or Don't Look Back in Anger. Then with less than 20 minutes delay, U2 came on stage. Larry Mullen started alone in the middle of the scenario situated at the center of the stadium and it all began... Thanks for allow us to remember a great album like Joshua Tree! All the songs in order, side A and side B if you like more the vinyl. And the last part... Amazing with songs like Elevation or Vertigo. And one last surprise... We could listen a new song from the upcoming album, Songs of Experience. No more to say: GREAT AS ALWAYS U2. We love you! ",1
U2,"Best concert I've ever seen and probably will ever see save for another U2 show. No seat was a bad seat as they had a massive 'screen' that spanned roughly half the length and a third of the height of MSG. The screen could be lowered and raised and there was a catwalk inside of it as well as under it on the floor for the band members to move around on. Animations and live videos of the band members playing were projected onto the screen and could be interacted with inside of the screen. I've never seen anything like it. They had a great mix of classic U2 songs and new ones all while using mixed media to create much more than a music concert. This was a retrospective art show, film screening, advocacy platform, etc. A final treat was Bruce Springsteen coming on near the end of the show trading mics with Bono to sing Where the Streets Have No Name. You have got to see this band live. ",1
U2,"U2 is a big part of the history of rock and roll, and music in general. They always have been since I have memory. Their Montreal concert on June 5 did not fall short from other performances over the years. They opened in a simple yet intense manner with three songs from their latest album. They followed with I Will Follow and Gloria, which are of course songs featured in Boy and Gloria, their first two studio albums. They followed with a mix of classic songs with songs from Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience. The show is truly enjoyable even though it lacks classics like With or Without You, Mysterious Ways or New Year's Day. It was a great experience (no pun intended), and I really looking forward to attending another concert soon. ",1
U2,U2 are a mega band and with that they have quite a few critics But these shows were the perfect reply to their critics this was a masterpiece of stadium gigging The focus was a celebration of their monster album The Joshua Tree... the album that broke America. Tonight was a celebration and nostalgia trip. The sound was crystal clear and brilliantly stage set Behind a simple stage set was an immense TV screen which beamed out superb videos The crowd were on top form The irony was ending with Noel Gallagher playing together Don't Look Back in Anger which the crowd gladly sang as we left Twickenham I nearly missed this and so glad I didn't Down the Front ,1
U2,"Over the years I never missed a U2 tour concert (and I've seen many several times). I believe this one belongs to my personal top-5. Not only because of the awesome Anton Corbijn made movies, but moreover because of the extremely well played songs. A big compliment for that to all 4, they were all great! But specially for Bono who's voice was superb. In acoustics the Amsterdam Arena is normally a poor venue. But on Sunday, the evening that I was there, the sound was perfect. What else is there to wish in the future? Apart from good healthiness I would say, a nice 10-15.000 spectator venue, without cell phones in the audience, no video walls, but just the U2 music... ",1
U2,"The O2 arena was a new experience for me.  I'd previously seen U2 only in outdoor stadiums in Auckland and Wellington, New Zealand.  The stage was amazing - I've no idea how they could do that outdoor. It was great to hear songs from the new album - greatest hits concerts are for bands past their prime - and they sounded so very good. Still its not a U2 concert without some of the old stuff and my personal favourite With or Without You was a highlight for me. Patti Smith was a real surprise and she fitted in perfectly. What a great way to open an close. U2 are also always innovating to stay fresh and this concert was no exception.  See you in NZ boys ",1
U2,U2 was pretty good if quite formulaic (exactly the same show as 90% of the rest of th I+E Tour). I think they are best when they are lined up in rock-n-roll T formation (Bono in front of Larry with Edge out left and Adam on the right). They used this for Beautiful Day and it was a truly great rock-n-roll moment. Like seeing them rehearsing in Bono's garage on Cedarwood Road...my other favorites were Every Breaking Wave (acoustic) with the Edge on piano and Bono singing and the closer before the encore: With or Without You. I was quite disappointed that this particular show was shorter than all the other ones in this tour. ,0
U2,"Super concert, very good atmosphere, the show was there with a great staging which was well related to the music played. The group is really very active on stage which made the concert all the more alive. The only negative point was, in my opinion, the first part, Noel Gallagher was not very catchy, contrary to our expectations because Oasis is a group that I love but there, the part of Noel was a little disappointing, too bad. In any case, the U2 concert is a concert not to be missed if you like the group because it is well worth the detour!",1
U2,"It was the best concert I've ever gone to. Edge was amazing with his guitar solos and piano riffs, While Bono energizing the crowd with constant dancing and all of his antics including dancing with a random girl from The crowd. Larry was an absolute monster on the drums, he looks great for his age and he kept smashing the kit with all of his might for 2 hours. Adam looked awesome while he kept the rythm and held his classic Clayton pose and stance while playing a mean bass. The films and light shows were Fantastic as well, and I am impressed with the quality of the shirt I purchased. ",1
U2,"The audio was amazing, the sound was probably one of the best concerts I've attended. Visually it was bad.  Most of the performance was blocked by the Giants screen in the middle of the stage. If you were seated on the sides of the bowl, your experience was probably fine. However, if you were seated on either end of the Garden, you missed the MAJORITY of the show. Very disappointed that when I bought the tickets there was no disclaimer that the entire show would have an obstructed view. I could only see the band 25% of the time, which is a very bad percentage for a venue like MSG.... ",0
U2,"I have been following and attending U2 live concerts for almost 30 years, and I was a bit doubtful about this tour - the 2015 Innnonce tour didn't give me great emotions. ....how much wrong I was!!!! The live was great, the band powerful, the set-list was balanced and - even if I would have made some changes - it was very good. Attending from the parterre gave me the possibility to walk around the stage, from one side to the other of the venue,seeing the band on the main stage, on the acoustic stage and on the bridge. Great, see them again in Dublin in a few days! ",1
Adele,"We visited Adèle. Not at her home, but in the Ziggodome. Recently she is no longer as a house sparrow as she used to be. We were quite nervous beforehand, because we had never been to her before. Completely for free, of course, because as soon as you sit together it is very nice. In fact, it was so much fun that a sense of deprivation now prevails and the realization that such an experience is now far away. Adele in Ziggodome 06-06-2016 (59) Yes, it was great what Adèle did. It was the last concert in a row of 4, so we read both positive and negative things. And believe me all negative comments are nagging, that is searching. It was almost perfect, only during 1 song on the middle stage the basses started to pile up, causing an annoying rumbling to drown out the rest of the music every now and then. Only 1 song was not perfect sound wise. But that's all. Adele in Ziggodome 06-06-2016 (58) The music of Radiohead or Pink Floyd cannot be compared to that of Adèle. As an artist she is of the same order of magnitude. Just a few weeks ago, Radiohead was a memorable concert at the HMH and now another intense experience has been added. Not in the traditional sense of a pop concert, but in the unique variant that Adèle has made of it. A kind of living room as a stage for her voice. (Ultimately, the living room is the best place to really listen to music in all the details.) Adèle has a glorious voice, a voice that can touch you deeply. Along with an accompaniment that perfectly complements her voice. The man behind the sound has also achieved a great result in that regard. The band / accompaniment orchestra was present, but Adèle remained in the foreground in a very nice mix. Live, but in the detail of the sound the experience of a studio recording. Everything revolves around Adèle's music, where her voice occupies such an important place. One thought during the concert was, ""This woman has everything."" The voice, the ability to write beautiful music. The environment to make this a beautiful product. The team to make a live performance a sensation. The finesse to it unforgettable. Adele in Ziggodome 06-06-2016 (45) Confetti with handwritten messages from Adèle! Who thinks about it and who also carries it out: Adèle and her team. She only has a big ass, as she herself shouted in her English language during the ""selfie session"" to the public, but even that is debatable whether that is a downside. Not to mention a family and a family life. She just goes into bicycles with her son Amsterdam. Adele in Ziggodome 06-06-2016 (5) Most important of all, she lets us enjoy her talents. Some people find the chatter between songs annoying, I personally find it a very nice personal way to put each song on a pedestal. That singing alone cannot remain fascinating in itself is compensated for by an extra stage. There ""Set Fire To The Rain"" was even provided with a real rain Adele in Ziggodome 06-06-2016 (64) curtain around her. Wonderful, I admit that I have a thing for water, but still. The effort is being made to make this happen. That she took ample time for a ""selfie session"" with the audience around her, I just find it amusing and enjoy her humor in commenting on her posing postures. If only we had stood there, and could also take a selfie. Adele in Ziggodome 06-06-2016 (63) Also on the setlist you can only say that it is never enough. The opener ""Hello"" was self-evident and immediately short-circuited everything involved in feeling in my body. A kind of joy that I cramp during the following songs slowly recovered until ""Water Under The Bridge"" caused another ""suffocation"". It is strange to me that ""Skyfall"" fell from the sky with an attack on the control. More beautiful than ever. ""Make You Feel My Love"" remains special as a cover, also a tribute to Bob Dylan. That way I can say something about almost all the following songs. That would be too much. At a certain point Adèle announced the end of the evening, causing a slight panic over me. Shit, time has gone fast! Have I absorbed and experienced everything well Adele in Ziggodome 06-06-2016 (71) enough? Nonsense of course, but reason to suck in the rest of the evening and experience every moment. Also looking around me to see if this is being recorded on video. I couldn't discover it, but as far as I am concerned it is a must. I want to see and hear this again. What a beautiful evening!

Adele,"The journey from the center of the arena to the main stage was lit by camera phones and shrieks of joy. Once there, “Hello” transitioned into “Hometown Glory”. London landmarks gave way to the Denver skyline, as the lyrics changed from ‘my hometown’ to ‘your hometown.’ What could have come across as gimmicky at some mainstream country show, somehow rang true as an honest tribute to the city in which Adele was an honored guest. The cynic in me didn’t want to show any emotion, but there was something so enchanting about the way she sang “the wonders of my world”, while images of the Rocky Mountains towered above her, that I just couldn’t help myself. It had been less than ten minutes since she had first appeared and I was already powerless against her charm. “How many of you did not want to come tonight?” (only someone with extreme self-confidence would ask that question, so when a few men confirmed, she had the perfect response.) “Thank you for being a good sport and making my show sold out.” Speaking as one of those people who don’t listen to Adele’s music on a regular basis, my biggest complaint is the lack of variation across her songs. There is no denying that voice of hers, but I feel like her albums are very vanilla. I do believe her lack of range is by design though. Keeping it safe is what has allowed her to appeal to so many, while offending so few. Last night didn’t exactly change my mind when it came to her songs, but her tremendous personality and sense of humor provided a depth that I wasn’t aware of before. She could have performed the entire concert solo and I would have been entertained. The fact that the screen eventually dropped after “One and Only”, exposing twenty musicians, including a whole crew of extraordinary backup singers, just added to the spectacle. “My music isn’t that much fun…I hope you knew that. I do have a couple upbeat ones… let’s get them out of the way, so we can cry.” Self-confidence gave way to self-awareness as the crowd came alive for “Rumour Has It” — one of the few songs you could actually dance to. There was a very classic feel to the presentation. The stage was framed in solid light, while Adele’s image projected in black-and-white like some movie star from the 50’s. The stellar band was separated into strings, percussion, and voice; all indispensable to each composition, but also completely anonymous and respectful of who they were there to serve. For a diva, Adele was surprisingly approachable as well. When she asked questions, she made it a point to listen to the answers coming from the front rows. There was a dialogue between her and her fans. When she saw a guy in a purple shirt, passionately singing along, she invited him and his friends on stage to take a selfie.

Adele,"It is hard to know what to say that hasn't already been said, the list of superlatives has been done and each one is accurate. Adele may be nervous performing live, and there are times where that shows through, but somehow the fact that, arguably, the worlds finest singer shows a vulnerability adds to the performance especially when combined with her self deprecating honesty. The attention to detail is clear, the fact that she thanks the guy who delivers 'hot honey' by name, thanks the guys who surround the stage during Skyfall and says 'see you all Saturday' shows that she is no Prima Donna artiste, Somehow through a meteoric rise, through all the fame and fortune she still retains that ordinary north London girl wanting to entertain her audience and entertain she does, in spades! The T Shirts personally signed fired into the crowd, the note left on the back of someone's seat all these acts of kindness make someone's night unforgettable. However, all of the humour, beautiful touches and adept performance are totally dominated by that voice, that wonderful, utterly unmistakable, beautiful voice which towered over Wembley Stadium and owned the evening. The songs are expertly crafted works of art in their own right and I love them all but if she sang the phone book I would pay to listen. The highlights for me are predictable, Hello, Skyfall, Feel my Love, Set Fire to the Rain and Someone Like You, all of which were belted out by 100,000 people, these are the spine tingling moments you experience rarely in life. The one song I would still love to hear live is River Lea, lyrically brilliant and one of my all time favourite songs. If you have never seen Adele perform live you really do need to and this may be your last chance, although I cannot tell you how much I hope it is not! ",1
Adele,"Having seen Adele previously at the Hammersmith Apollo a few years ago we really wanted to get tickets again, my wife tried for many hours to get tickets for her last tour and when this 4 night tour went on sale she tried again we were successful getting tickets for the Wednesday night, the only problem was she had no choice but to buy the drinking package at £249 each but because we wanted to see her we had no choice but to buy them.  We had had an email form Songkick advising us to arrive early for security check which was understandable in the light of recent events, the line to enter was building up when we arrived at 4.30 pm, everyone was waiting for the 5pm opening, 5pm passed and everyone were patient but they did not start letting people in until around 5.20 pm.  Eventually we were let in to the Bobby Moore suite to start the evening with a drink, the food choice for the suite was very limited, sushi, salad or hot dog (which were not hot at all), we enjoyed a few glasses of wine before we entered the stadium.  Once we got to our seats for the start of the show is when we realised that if we wanted to see anything we should have taken binoculars even though we were only on the second tier to be honest Adele was a dot on the stage.  Adele performance was amazing and once again she meet our every expectations she has an brilliant voice and is so down to earth.  Paying that kind of money to see her show was worth it just to experience her voice and music, but paying that kind of money for the entry to the Bobbie Moore suite (which was just a function room) was really over priced.  We had a fantastic time listening to Adele but the before part was a total waste of money. ",0
Adele,"Few artists have enjoyed the success over the course of a career spanning several decades that Adele has achieved over the past few years. Escaping the curse of that dreaded second album, ‘21’ propelled Adele into superstardom faster than anyone could have predicted and has broken probably every record that was there to be broken. Seeing Adele live at the Royal Albert Hall back in 2011 was a really special moment. Clearly overwhelmed by the whirlwind success of the album, she took to the stage with a vulnerability that made her instantly likeable and relatable, whilst still delivering a class A performance. Chatting to the audience like they were all friends and wanting them to feel like they were watching the gig ‘in their living rooms’, the most special moment of the evening came when the every single member of the 5000 strong audience belted the lyrics to hit single ‘Someone Like You’, leaving a speechless Adele visibly emotional and barely a dry eye in the house. No big production or special effects were needed, as the beauty of the live arrangements and of those lyrics that made ‘21’ the masterpiece that it is, were enough. Having publicly admitted that she suffers with severe stage fright, it is probable that we will not witness Adele touring arenas or stadiums. I believe this to be a good thing, as the beauty of her live show could not be appreciated in such big surroundings.  Just make sure your one of the few who gets a ticket. ",1
Adele,"I was waiting ages and hoping Adele would announce a new tour since the 21 tour that i missed for being minutes slow for the tickets. As the 25 tour was announced my only goal was to get those tickets at any cost! Everything seemed go bad from the start as the page for the ticket pre-sale did not work for me. I had no choice but to divert to viagogo and pay my ass off for two tickets - all my savings were lost... BUT - it definitely WAS WORTH EVERY DIME! After few hours driving, overnight trip by ship and frustrating times getting to the concert area - We finally really were there. I did not know what to expect from the show. But what ever it would be, i knew i would love just to see and hear her sing live. As the show kicked off the feeling was just phenomenal - the emotion was to be hand felt. The show was not rockets, pyros and any fancy stuff... just Adele and smooth graphics and wisely chosen video backgrounds. But what else would it even need - nothing! Because... Adele! The show kept the audience in it's embrace the whole set. It even made the bond to the audience deeper as she really got involved in person with some of us. She asked a couple fans up on stage and even sang a duet with one! Anyways - will recommend to go see and hear her live to everyone! Adele is my number one female artist and i would not have missed her live tour again - and am really happy i did not. Go, see, hear and love Adele! ",1
Adele,"First, I must say, that show was AMAZING!!!The black & white screen matches her music style perfectly, including the videos playing on. Let's talk about Adele and her performance.She's a talented singer over the world, of course. Not only she can write and sing such good songs as Hello, When we were young, Send my love, etc., but also she's able to control the live show very well.Her voice, stage style, funny small talk between songs, even the eye contact with each audiences, proves that she can hold this grand show all by herself! That is a two-hour performance without any silence break, except for 3 minutes underground walk from central stage to main stage. It's unbelievable since almost all songs she sang were highly difficult! She is a kind and responsible singer, also. No matter where you are, you can receive her beautiful smile and shining eyesight during the concert. She can even play jokes nearby the crowd! That must be everybody's good memory! Her humors and straightly personal characters make her so closed with fans. After each song, you may just treat her as a good friend when she talking! As a VIP, I do think it's valuable to have such good musical listening and watching experience, except for the seat, which is not good enough for a VIP. However, that should be the problem of the hall's condition. I must say, you should go for at least one Adele's concert in your life! ",1
Adele,"Our family of 4 daughters, my husband and myself saw Adele on 10/03/17, her first Sydney show. We have loved Adele since we listened to her first album in 2010. As soon as we heard she was coming we knew we had to be there. Even though we were seated  very far away from the stage Adele made everyone of the 950000 crowd feel like we were all much closer. Every moment was fantastic, Adele's phenomenal voice, the amazing video footage of Adele's eyes opening as the show started to the final song of Someone Like You, where the sound of the huge crowd singing in unison with Adele was unlike anything I have ever heard. The circular stage setup was amazing, giving everyone access to seeing Adele. Adele walked the circle giving every part of the stadium a chance to see her. The video footage that played with the songs was beautiful and ensured you kept your eyes on the stage. The set list was a wonderful collection of Adele's 3 albums. Her interaction with the audience was funny, sincere and she really made us feel like we were right there with her. I think when you see your daughters crying with the emotion of getting to see Adele live and then more crying because it was even better than you could of dreamed, speaks volumes. I would see her again in a heartbeat if I could and would say to anyone if you can go then do it! ",1
Adele,"I attended her concert in the biggest venue here in Oslo, Norway – Telenor Arena. It is perhaps mostly known for its lack of acoustic quality. The room is simply put way too big and sterile for that. Nevertheless; The Adele Tour team actually pulled it off this time though, and were able to fill the «dead» space in a more that satisfying manner. Now, enough said about the venue. To the music: Being the big fan that I am it would be hard to hide my subjective judgement of the performance and music presented by Adele. But with that said I think it is fair to say that she, as a performer, is one of the best there is in the world today. She gives a lot of herself to the audience and often includes random attendees in the most spontaneous ways. Music wise there is almost nothing to say other than that it is absolutely outstanding. Adele brings such a huge presence with her voice, unlike anyone else in the industry. Even the less “complicated” songs become big and overwhelmingly magnificent. All in all, you get the feeling that Adele knows how it is to be “on the other side” (had to write that) and therefore she isn’t afraid of posing for a selfie or giving out large amounts of waves to the crowd. There is no doubt that Adele forever will be remembered as one of the greatest artist of our century. ",1
Adele,"The show was a dream come true. Adele is beautiful, charming, kind, warm, and breathtaking. I sincerely can't say enough about her. Her voice was crisp and clear and 100x better than the studio version and I can't believe that's even possible. She created such a personable and intimate experience in an arena by interacting with the audience and carrying conversations with us. She'd stop nearly after every song to chat with us about the song, her thought process when writing it, her feelings and experiences when the song came out, etc. It was like being at a release party and I loved it! It was like she was an old friend who felt like home. She had two stages, one at the front and one in the back to be closer to those sitting far away. She had a large screen spanning across the front stage so that you could get good video feeds of her performance, which was refreshing as the last few concerts I've been to didn't consider the people sitting in the back. Seeing the artist perform live and listening to them live are all part of the concert experience and seeing them is a large enhancement. She even had her own rain room and her band was fantastic. Seriously. I would go again and again and again. I love Adele. She's genuine, humble, and her voice is one-of-a-kind. I'm blessed to have her as part of our generation. ",1
Adele,"I am not going to review the show, as this has been done by thousands of others. What I will review is the package that I paid for. This was a birthday present for my wife. So as a special event I decided to make it special by getting the Premium Seat & Exclusive Merchandise Package. This package got you the following: .Reserved seat in a premium location - YES WE GOT RESERVED SEATS BUT SPOILT BY HAVING A CAMERA GANTRY WHICH BLOCKED OUR VIEW WHEN ADELE WALKED TO THE FRONT OF THE STAGE. IN HINDSIGHT WE WOULD HAVE HAD A BETTER VIEW HAD WE JUST BOUGHT STANDING TICKETS. .Limited edition screen print .Limited edition tote bag .Adele Live 2017 tour programme – WE WERE TOLD ON COLLECTION OF OUR MERCHANDISE THAT THE TOUR PROGRAMME WAS NOT INCLUDED AS THE ONES THEY HAD WERE FROM THE AUSTRALIA/NEW ZEALAND LEG OF THE TOUR??? SORRY....WAS THIS WEMBLEY EVENT A LAST MINUTE THROWN TOGETHER THING. PISS POOR, PISS POOR. .Limited edition show laminate and lanyard .Limited edition commemorative ticket All in all Adele was brilliant and my wife loved it. But I felt I had let her down as I had promised her good seats and we got good seats WITH A RESTRICTED VIEW. The moral of the story is “all that glistens might not be gold”. ",-1
Adele,"Not worth seeing in a large venue like Madison Square Garden. She's a huge star so it makes sense that she plays the amount of seats she can sell out for (gotta make them $$), but the music type and quality is just not suited to this kind of setting. Beacon Theater would be a great spot to watch her perform since she's not much of a performer beyond the superhuman voice. It's an intimate experience that's bastardized by having her sing in a voluminous atmosphere. Her music relies too heavily on the slow-tempo ballads, and for that reason she doesn't have the energy to excite a crowd of 20,000 people. She should really consider this when moving on to her fourth album. More upbeat standards in the style of Amy Winehouse would be awesome stuff for her. Because let's face it, listening to Adele when you're alone manifesting sorrow = perfect mood setting. Watching Adele manifesting sorrow = sadness, boredom, and general displeasure. I can't believe I PAID to have someone depress me. On my BIRTHDAY no less. Oh well, she does make up for it by being generally goofy and funny, talking to the audience intermittently - something that takes me full circle to my point - something that would be better appreciated in a smaller venue.

Adele,"I went to see Adele at the 1th of June 2016 in the Ziggodome in Amsterdam. I'm a big fan of her since day one. 19, 21 and now 25 and she is still getting better! I already bought tickets in december'15 so i waited for nearly 7 months until it finally took place. I red some reviews from her concert in London and they were all terrific, so now i was even more excited! When i entered the Ziggodome the first thing i saw were these amazing closed eyes of Adele on the screen. And then the moment the show starts.. This blew my mind!! Here eyes on the screen openend and Adele came on stage starting with Hello. She did all here top songs from every album like Hometown Glory, Someone Like You and When We Were Young. The whole two hours i obessively watched this woman singing and chatting. She talks about her songs, laughed with these hilarious giggles and making jokes and selfies with fans. I stood there with goosebumps, tears in my eyes and this amazing good feeling. I honestly never heard anyone live with such a clear voice as Adele!! Her band was amazing too! When you think you can't love Adele more then you already did... go to this concert;) This was the best concert ever!! Nothing but love from Holland X ",1
Adele,"This review is dealing with concert entry.  I purchased my tickets and had to pick them up at the arena the night of the concert.  The doors were supposed to open at 6:00.  They did not open until 6:40.  We got into a very long line at 6:40.  People in line were very upset, because, after an hour, we were still not anywhere close to the arena to get in due to the length of the line. The concert was supposed to start at 7:30, but did not start until about 8:00.  After almost 90 minutes in line, we walked in the door as Adele was singing her blockbuster hit, ""Hello"".  We were unable to get to our seat until mid-way through the second song. After working so hard to secure tickets, showing up in plenty of time, and still missing part of the concert?  This is unacceptable.  When I questioned the United Center personnel, they said this choice of how this was run was due to Adele's concert management's choice versus United Center policies. Adele's management needs to examine their policies, change how they manage events and realize they have many, many frustrated and disappointed fans who did not get to fully experience what should have been a phenomenal event. ",-1
Adele,"I thought the show was amazing. I got the tickets through the pre-sale. Even though I was quite disappointed in the seat selection I was able to get through the pre-sale when I logged into the site at the exact time the pre-sale started for her Monday night show in Chicago, they ended up being okay for nose-bleeds. We were right in front of her and her main screen. Adele has always been my favorite and a role model and as soon as she came out, I started crying and could not stop until a song and a half later. At the end of the day, I can say I was at least in the same room as her even though I was more than willing to pay a lot more money to see her/be closer to her. Lastly, I've never been to the United Center before, so that was neat. People have told me that their sound quality there isn't that good and I only experienced that when she talked in between her pieces. I wished they were able to get her a different mic or turn up the volume on it immensely because I was not able to hear in some parts as well as my mother. Nothing on her because she has such great talent, a voice, and is such a doll. I hope she tours again because I will definitely go! ",0
Adele,"The visual effects, stage management, Adele interaction and story telling was all brilliant..... BUT the supplied sound system was absolutely awful and totally inadequate for the application.  The sound was diabolical, useless, distorted and completely drowned by the obtrusive bass from the drums. I have never endured such a rubbish sound system; I have always walked out!  The only singing I got to hear at all was Adele's ballads where there was NO baseline at all.  However the reverberation could now be clearly heard. A centrally located sound source in a predominately concrete round structure is bound to fail with so many reflecting surfaces.  Was the obnoxious bass levels designed to swamp the reverb? Value for money; never. If there is a class action against Wembley Stadium I will be signing as a refund will be demanded. Poor Adele, she does not deserve such treatment and could not have been offered a solution. Regards Angus McClare ",-1
Adele,"The. Best. Night. Of. My. Entire. Life. This was the second time for me to see Adele. Last time I was quite high up, this time I was in Golden Circle. The atmosphere was incredible, Adele made me feel like I was the only one there in a packed out stadium. The banter she has with her audience in hilarious, she includes everyone and t feels like you're hanging out with your best mate you've known for years. As for her songs, the emotion and passion she sings with is just so raw and heart warming, I cried so many tears. You can tell she has an absolute ball on stage and she has so many upbeat songs and the sass she has is unreal- it cracks me up every time! I feel so grateful to have been apart of this tour and so happy that Adele decided to share this experience with every single one of us. I hope she has the most relaxing break with her family and hope she knows we'll always be here for her whenever/ if she decides to come back. Xx ",1
Adele,"Adele was freaking amazing Big love 4 her. But i had the vip tickets ive payed 250€ for the show. The doors was supposed to be open at 6.30 , it was 6 and i was outside the door waiting to open , in the rain , the vip people didnt let me in , they said no its not time yet we were wet , there was no shed .My sister had a regular ticket 121€ en she was earlier inside then me , while i payed 250€ for early entrance . And a friend payed 121€ en his seats was even better then mine in the concert hall in antwerp . Adele has called him even on stage . Because he had a good place better then the vip ticket what ive got. I was seated on the side from the stage 3 row and that friend of mine without vip had a seat infront of the stage 1st row . Im not a complainer but this was not correct , its a lot of money i payded . Just wanted to say this , its to bad But adele is great , best concert ive ever seened ",0
Adele,"His eyes were opened with the greatest punctuality ever seen in the Palau Sant Jordi, at least seen by a server. A meticulous show and attention to detail. Adele is a soloist and is characterized by little dynamic themes, however, that concert was anything but boring, she is a born comedian and she never ceased to amaze us. She is tender as the mother she is now, and at the same time a scoundrel. The sobriety of the stage, the quality of the audiovisual, and the coherence made this show the most elegant known. I would have paid to enjoy it like those who were sitting on the dance floor did, to see her up close and dance to her ballads. A bittersweet show, I am happy to have been there, but sad because it is over and it is only part of our memory, for that reason, I suppose, I will continue listening to ""When We Were Young"" and I will remember that May night with much affection .",1
